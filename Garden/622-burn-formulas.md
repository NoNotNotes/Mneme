The Parkland Formula may be used to determine the amount of fluid to be infused into the patient.
$$LR = 4\text{ mL}\times\text{TBSA\%}\times\text{Weight (kg)}$$
The final volume to be given is divided into three segments in the first 24 hours, 8 hours each.
1. First 8 hours: 50% of the total volume to be given.
2. Next 8 hours: 25% of the total volume to be given.
3. Next 8 hours: 25% of the total volume to be given.

**Total Body Surface Area** is calculated with the **Rule of 9s**:

|Anterior Trunk|18%|18%|
|Posterior Trunk|18%|18%|
|Upper Extremities|9% each|9% each|
|Lower Extremities|18% each|14% each|
|Genital|1%|0%|
