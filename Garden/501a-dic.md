**Disseminated intravascular coagulation** is a coagulation disorder causing an over-activation of the clotting cascade. This results in simultaneous thrombosis and hemorrhage. May be acute or chronic; highly fatal. Because of the overuse of clotting factors, bleeding is a problem despite the abnormal rates of coagulation. Two contrasting problems cause high difficulty in treatment for severe cases.
- **Signs and Symptoms**:
	- **Clotting**: Chest pain, shortness of breath, myocardial infarction (from obstruction of coronary arteries), cerebral effects from decreased perfusion (LOC changes)
	- **Internal Bleeding**: hematuria, melena/occult blood in stool, hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhaging (changes in LOC)
	- **External Bleeding**: hematoma (subcutaneous bleeding), mucosal bleeding, purpura/petechiae/bruising.
- **Diagnostics**: CBC (Platelet count and clotting factor counts are reduced, PT and PTT times are increased)
- **Medical Management**: treat the underlying cause (if known).
	- Secondarily, correct ischemia by improving oxygenation, replacing fluids, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and administering vasopressor medications.
	- Replace overused clotting factors and platelets via transfusion of cryoprecipitate and fresh-frozen plasma.
	- Controversial in use, but heparin may also be used
- **Nursing Interventions**:
	- **Maintain hemodynamic status**: observe procedures to minimize wounding and risk for bleeding.
	- **Monitor for imbalanced fluid volume**: faulty circulation may result in fluid retention. Assess for edema and monitor breath sounds. Administer diuretics and minimize IV volume as prescribed.
	- **Assess for ineffective tissue perfusion related to microthrombi**: assess neurologic, pulmonic, and skin systems.
