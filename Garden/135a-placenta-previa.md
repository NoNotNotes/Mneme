The **premature separation of an abnormally low implanted placenta**. This is the most common cause of bleeding in the third trimester, occurring in 1:150 to 1:200 pregnancies. Risk factors for placenta previa include:
- **Multiparity** (high partiy): the single **most important** factor
- **Upper uterine segment dysfunction**: decreased vascularity, scarring, tumors
- **Advanced maternal age**: >35 years
- **Multiple pregnancy**

The patient will exhibit the following signs and symptoms:
1. **Painless vaginal bleeding** of **bright red, fresh blood** in the third trimester (7th month). This may be slight or profuse coming after an activity, coitus, or internal examination.
2. **Soft, flaccid uterus** with intermittent hardening if in labor.
3. **Intermittent pain** if placenta previa occurs secondary to uterine contractions in labor.

The determination of placenta previa is imaging through **ultrasonography**, giving a 95% accurate result and detects the site of the placenta done early in the pregnancy.

>[!INFO] Vaginal Delivery with a Previa
>When the placental tip measures between 1 and 12 cm from the internal cervical os, up to 90% of these patients will deliver successfully via the vaginal route. As long as the inferior margin of the placenta is at least 2 cm from the internal os, there is no significant increased risk of bleeding during labor.
