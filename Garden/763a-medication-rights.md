**Reference**: Lecturer (Notario)

1. **Right Patient**: identify the patient with at least two identifiers. For this specific right, take into consideration that there are two categories of patients: conscious and unconscious.
	- **Conscious**: alert, coherent, and aware patients. For these clients, you may **ask the client to state their name**
	- **Unconscious**: comatose. For these clients, you may **check the ID bracelet/band/label**
2. **Right Drug**: there are four elements in checking the validity of the drug being given:
	- **Expiration**: check the date of expiration of the medication.
	- **Color**: changes in color can indicate errors or invalidity.
	- **Spelling**: in written prescriptions, the spelling of medication names should be double-checked. Some drugs can go as far as to differ by one syllable.
	- **Label**: checked thrice; once when receiving the order, second when opening or dispensing, and third when administering the medication.
3. **Right Dose**: **double-checking** is always imperative for giving drugs. No excess or deficit against the prescribed amount should be administered. This is done especially for (a) **multiple drugs**, (b) **sudden changes of orders**, (c) **available stock dose does not match order**. The relevant formulae used for calculating the required dose includes:
	- **Pediatric Doses**:
		- **Clark's Rule**: `Weight (pounds) / 150 * Adult Dose`
		- **Fried's Rule** (12 months and below): `Age (months) / 150 * Adult Dose`
		- **Young's Rule**: `Age (years) / (Age (years) + 12) * Adult Dose`
	- **Adult Doses**: `Dose / Stock * Quantity`
	- **IV Calculation**: `Total Volume / Hrs. to Infuse * Drop Factor / 60 Minutes` DF may be defined as macro (20) or micro (60).
4. **Right Frequency**: the usage of correct intervals between dosages. This is written on the order, with standardized abbreviations. Depending on the institution, the timings of non-specific frequencies can vary.
