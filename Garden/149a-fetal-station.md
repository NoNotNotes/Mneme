Station refers to the **relationship of the presenting part to the ischial spines, the single most important landmark of the pelvis**. It measures how far the presenting part has descended into the pelvis— the degree of descent. Each station is one centimeter and determined through internal examination.
1. **Floating** (High; Ballottable): unengaged presenting part
2. **Station 0**: the presenting part is **at the level of the ischial spines**.
3. **Minus Station** (Negative): if the presenting part is above the level of the ischial spines, station is expressed as a negative number (e.g., -1 (1 cm above), -2 (2 cm above)).
4. **Plus Station** (Positive): if the presenting part is below the ischial spines (outlet), station is expressed as a positive number (e.g., +1 (1 cm below), +2 (2 cm below)).

| -5 to 0 | The “presenting” or most palpable (able to feel) part of the baby is above the woman’s ischial spines.                          |
| 0       | The baby’s head is known to be “engaged,” or aligned with the ischial spines.                                                   |
| 0 to +5 | Positive numbers are used when a baby has descended beyond the ischial spines. During birth, a baby is at the +4 to +5 station. |
