Arterial blood pressure is the pressure placed on the blood vessels by the heart during its systolic (contractile) and diastolic (relaxed) phases.
1. **Systolic Pressure**: the blood pressure at the moment of ejection/during contraction of the heart.
2. **Diastolic Pressure**: the blood pressure at the moment of filling/relaxation of the heart.
3. **Pulse Pressure**: the pressure difference between systolic and diastolic ($\text{PP}=\text{SP}-\text{DP}$) that indicates the amount of pressure produced by a contraction of the heart, which is often used to reflect fluid status of an individual. It normally sits around 40 mm Hg and ranges from 30 to 50 mm Hg. A consistently heightened pulse pressure occurs in arteriosclerosis, and a low pulse pressure occurs in conditions such as severe heart failure.
4. **Mean Arterial Pressure**: the actual pressure actually delivered to the body's organs. There are a few ways to calculate this value. Try to check which one is the easiest to remember or to perform.
	- (1) Calculating MAP: $\text{MAP}=\frac{1}{3}(\text{SP})+\frac{2}{3}(\text{DP})$
	- (2) Calculating MAP: $\text{MAP}=\text{DP}+\frac{1}{3}(\text{Pulse Pressure})$
	- (3) Calculating MAP: $\text{MAP}=\frac{\text{SP}+2(\text{DP})}{3}$

# Determinants and Factors Affecting Blood Pressure
Determinants are the aspects that make up the pressure forces measured in blood pressure.
1. **Pumping Action of the Heart**: weaker pumping equates to lower cardiac output, and decreased blood pressure. The opposite is also true.
2. **Peripheral Vascular Resistance**: vascular capacity (internal diameter of capillaries and arterioles), arterial compliance, and blood viscosity affect peripheral vascular resistance— the pressure the blood has to fight against to flow. Increased vasoconstriction (such as in smoking), increased viscosity, or arteriosclerosis are all causes for increasing peripheral vascular resistance, increasing blood pressure.
3. **Blood Volume**: blood volume is proportional to blood pressure. In cases of fluid overload from rapid IV infusion or pregnancy, blood pressure increases.
4. **Blood Viscosity**: thick blood (hemoconcentration; Hct > 60%-65%) makes blood more resistant to flow, necessitating an increased blood pressure.

Factors are extraneous conditions that contribute to blood pressure, but is not directly a constituent of blood pressure.
1. **Age**: newborns have a systolic pressure of about 75 mm Hg, which rises with age, reaching its peak during puberty, then declines somewhat. In older adults, arteriosclerosis elevates systolic and even diastolic pressure.
2. **Exercise**: physical activity increases cardiac output and hence blood pressure. For reliable assessment of resting blood pressure, **wait 20 to 30 minutes following exercise**.
3. **Stress**: stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system increases cardiac output and vasoconstriction of the arterioles, thus increasing the blood pressure reading; however, severe pain can decrease blood pressure greatly by inhibiting the vasomotor center and producing vasodilation.
4. **Race**: African American individuals older than 35 years tend to have higher blood pressures than other races of the same age.
5. **Sex**: females usually have lower blood pressures than males of the same age after puberty, raising after menopause. This difference is thought to be due to hormonal variations. After the age of 65, the rate of high blood pressure is higher in women than it is in men of the same age.
6. **Medications**: caffeine and many other medications may increase or decrease the blood pressure.
7. **Obesity**: childhood and adult obesity is a major predisposing factor for hypertension.
8. **Diurnal Variations**: similar to temperature, blood pressure is the lowest in early morning and peaks in the late afternoon or early evening.
9. **Medical Conditions**: any condition affecting cardiac output, blood volume, blood viscosity, or compliance of the arteries has a direct effect on the blood pressure.
10. **Temperature**: increased temperature from a fever increases metabolic rate, which increases blood pressure. However, in external heat vasodilation occurs which decreases blood pressure. Inversely, cold will cause vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure.

___

# Alterations in Blood Pressure
**Hypertension** is a persistent elevation of blood pressure. A single elevated blood pressure reading indicates the need for reassessment— a diagnosis is only made after two elevated measurements measured at different times. In most cases, hypertension is asymptomatic and is often a contributing factor to myocardial infarctions (heart attacks).
1. **Primary Hypertension**: the most common form of hypertension, whose cause is unknown.
2. **Secondary Hypertension**: hypertension resultant of known causes.

Factors associated with hypertension include thickening of the arterial walls, which reduces the size of the arterial lumen, and inelasticity of the arteries, as well as lifestyle factors as cigarette smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercise, high blood cholesterol levels, and continued exposure to stress.

**Hypotension** is a blood pressure that is below normal, that is, a systolic reading consistently between 85 and 110 mmHg in an adult whose normal pressure is higher than this. **Orthostatic Hypotension** (postural hypotension) is a blood pressure that decreases when the client changes from a supine to a sitting or standing position, often the result of peripheral vasodilation in which the blood leaves the central body organs, especially the brain, and moves to the periphery, often causing the client to feel faint.

>[!TIP] Assessing for Orthostatic Hypotension
>1. Place the client in a supine position for at least five minutes, then record the client's pulse and blood pressure.
>2. Assist the client to a seated or standing position. Immediately recheck the pulse and blood pressure in the same sites as previously, then again in three minutes.
>3. Record the results. A drop in blood pressure of 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic or an increase of 20 beats/min indicates orthostatic hypotension.

Hypotension may be caused by analgesics such as meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol), bleeding, severe burns, and dehydration. It is important to monitor hypotensive clients carefully to prevent falls.

# Assessing Blood Pressure
Manual blood pressure management is performed with a blood pressure cuff, a sphygmomanometer, and a stethoscope. The cuff consists of a bag (bladder) that is inflated with air. To the bladder, there are two tubes that connect the pump (bulb) and the sphygmomanometer, which displays the pressure in the bag. There are two types of sphygmomanometers: aneroid, which is a gauge with a calibrated dial with a needle that points to the calibrations; and digital, which eliminates the need to auscultate the client's systolic and diastolic blood pressures through a stethoscope. Doppler ultrasound stethoscopes are also used to assess blood pressure, especially useful for infants, obese clients, and clients in shock where blood pressure sounds are difficult to hear.

>[!TIP] Choosing Blood Pressure Cuff Sizes
>1. **Bladder Width**: 40% of the arm circumference, or 20% wider than the diameter. Erroneously high readings are found if the width is too narrow, and vice versa.
>2. **Bladder Length**: at least two-thirds of the limb's circumference.

The most common site for blood pressure assessment is the upper arm, but it may be measured from the forearm, wrist, or thigh in case of contraindications. These contraindications include:
- The site for assessment is injured or diseased.
- The limb for assessment has a cast or bulky bandage.
- The client has had surgical removal of breast or axillary (or inguinal) lymph nodes on that side.
- The client has an IV infusion or blood transfusion in that limb.
- The client has an arteriovenous fistula (e.g., for renal dialysis) in that limb.

Blood pressure may be measured directly or indirectly. Direct (invasive) monitoring involves the insertion of a catheter into the brachial, radial, or femoral artery. Arterial pressure is represented as wavelike forms displayed on a monitor. With correct placement, this pressure reading provides very highly accuracy. As nurses, most measurements will be done noninvasively; indirectly. This may be done with two techniques:
1. **Auscultatory Method**: the use of a stethoscope to listen for **Korotkoff sounds**, particularly phase 1 and phase 5, to determine the systolic and diastolic blood pressures respectively.
	- **Korotkoff Phase 1**: "A sharp tapping", which gradually becomes more intense.
	- **Korotkoff Phase 2**: "A swishing or whooshing sound".
	- **Korotkoff Phase 3**: "A thump softer than the tapping in phase 1", which sounds crisper and more intense but again softer than in phase 1.
	- **Korotkoff Phase 4**: "A softer blowing muffled sound that fades". In some institutions, this may be considered the "first diastolic measurement".
	- **Korotkoff Phase 5**: "Silence". The pressure level when the last sound is heard. This is the diastolic pressure commonly recorded.

>[!WARNING] Auscultatory Gap
>The **auscultatory gap** is a phenomenon where phase 1 to phase 3 of the Korotkoff sounds become difficult to hear and appear as silence, even when the pulse is still palpable. This results in an underestimated systolic blood pressure and an overestimated diastolic blood pressure. This phenomenon is demonstrated and explained by [Dr. Sourya Acharya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bROKExhsUOA) (also the source of the following image).
>![[assessment_auscultatory-gap.png|300]]

2. **Palpatory Method**: this method is less common, but is used when Korotkoff sounds cannot be heard and electronic equipment to amplify the sounds is not available, or to prevent misdirection from the presence of an auscultatory gap. Similar to the auscultatory method, the nurse uses light to moderate pressure to palpate the pulsations of the artery as the pressure in the cuff is released. The first pulsation felt after releasing the pressure in the cuff is the systolic pressure. A single whiplike vibration, felt in addition to the pulsations, identifies the point at which the pressure in the cuff nears the diastolic pressure. This vibration is no longer felt below the diastolic pressure.

>[!SUCCESS] Preparation
>Patients must rest approximately 15 minutes after activity for an accurate blood pressure reading. For those who are caffeinated or have smoked, a 30 minute rest period is given in order to obtain an accurate reading. When reading, the patient is seated if possible.

The nurse inflates the cuff one to two inches above the brachial artery (if being taken at the popliteal fossa) up to 30 to 50 mm Hg above the pressure where the pulse becomes obliterated. Once deflated slowly (2 to 3 mm Hg/s), there are five Korotkoff sounds that the nurse hears:
1. **Korotkoff 1**: the first tap or thud indicating the return of blood flow, representing the **systolic pressure**.
2. **Korotkoff 2**: a swishing or whooshing
3. **Korotkoff 3**: a thumping sound
4. **Korotkoff 4**: a blowing sound
5. **Korotkoff 5**: The following **silence**. The point at which the diastolic has returned, and is recorded as the **diastolic pressure**.

# Blood Pressure Across the Lifespan
1. **Infants**:
	- A pediatric stethoscope should be used.
	- The lower edge of the blood pressure cuff can be closer to the antecubital space of an infant.
	- Use the palpation method if auscultation is unsuccessful.
	- Arm and thigh pressures are equivalent in children under 1 year of age. (There is a difference of 20 to 30 mmHg in the systolic pressures of the arm and thigh in adults)
	- The systolic blood pressure of a newborn averages about 70 mmHg, but is not usually recorded due to technical difficulty except when problems are suspected.
2. **Children**:
	- Blood pressure should be measured in all children over 3 years of age and in children less than 3 years of age with certain medical conditions.
	- All steps of the procedures and what it will feel like should be explained. A demonstration on a doll can be done.
	- Use the palpation technique for children under 3 years old.
	- Cuff bladder width should be 40% and length should be 80% to 100% of the arm circumference.
	- Diastolic pressure is considered to be based on Korotkoff sounds phase 4 rather than phase 5 in children.
	- Arm and thigh pressures differ by about 10 mmHg.
	- In children, normal blood pressure can be determined quickly with the formula $\text{Normal SBP}=80+(2\times\text{Age in Years})$.
3. **Older Adults**:
	- Skin may become fragile. Cuff pressure should not be kept high for any longer than necessary.
	- Clients may be taking antihypertensives. Determine when the last dose was taken, if any.
	- Medications that cause vasodilation and also the loss of baroreceptor efficiency in older adults place them at an increased risk for having orthostatic hypotension. [[#^67ef80|Assess for orthostatic hypotension]].
	- If the client has arm contractures, assess the blood pressure by palpation, with the arm in a relaxed position. A wrist or thigh reading may be taken if this is not possible.
