Data collection is the stage in the research process wherein the data is actually collected or received from subjects to ascertain the veracity of the researcher's hypothesis and shall form the basis of the researcher's conclusion. Among all of the stages of the research process, it is often the most budget and time-consuming. Good data collection is based on three characteristics:
1. **Reliability**: if tested once or twice, the data will likely **yield the same result**.
2. **Validity**: the test measures what it is meant to measure. This includes face validity, content validity, and construct validity.
3. **Accuracy**: measurements are accurate and truthful.

Methods of data collection vary depending on requirements and resources:
1. **Questionnaires**: among the most accessible forms of data collection. These may be:
	- **Dichotomous**: Yes-No or True-False questions
	- **Rating Scale**: choices are categorized and subjects answer according to the criteria, most often utilizing a Likert scale. One example is a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 as "Never" and 5 as "Very Frequently".
2. **Observation**: data collection using one's senses. It is an ocular method of collecting descriptive behavioral data as it occurs.
	- **Participant Observation**: the observer actively joins the subject while performing observation.
	- **Non-Participant Observation**: the researcher is a mere passive observer during data collection.
	- **Structured Observation**: the researcher prepares a pre-determined list of phenomenon to observe for.
	- **Non-Structured Observation**: free-style observation.
3. **Interview**: the utilization of oral communication skills between the researcher and his source to obtain data. It may be:
	- **Structured**: a list of specific questions are asked in the same manner to all respondents.
	- **Unstructured**: informal and open-ended questions are being asked. A simple, normal conversation.
	- **Combined Method** (Semi-structured)
4. **Pre-existing data or Record**: data is collected from previous recordings, published, archives, or documented. It may be:
	- **Primary**: recorded by a source who actually experienced and observed a phenomena.
	- **Secondary**: second-hand information.
5. **Others**: Q-Sort, Projective Techniques, Delphi Technique, Physiologic Measures, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS Technique)
