# Cardinal Movements/Mechanisms of Labor
During labor, the fetal head and body must change positions to accommodate the irregular maternal pelvis. These positional changes are termed the **cardinal movements**, otherwise called the mechanisms of labor, namely: (*mn. DFIREERE*)
1. **Engagement**: the mechanism by which the greatest transverse diameter of the fetal head (biparietal diameter) passes through the pelvic inlet; the head is fixed in the pelvis.
2. **Descent**: the first requisite for the birth of the baby: the progression of the fetal head through the pelvis. This may occur earlier in a nulliparous woman, and usually begins with engagement in a multiparous woman. The degree of descent is measured by **station**. It spans from -5 to +5, with 0 at the level of the ischial spines. Each interval measures 1 cm above or below the ischial spines. There are four forces of descent:
	- Amniotic fluid pressure; thus, some obstetricians elect to rupture the bag of water with an amniotone (amniotomy) to enhance labor progress
	- Direct pressure of the contracting fundus/uterus upon the breech
	- Effects of contractions on the diaphragm and abdominal muscle contraction
	- Fetal body extension and straightening
3. **Flexion**: the mechanism that occurs when the head meets resistance from the cervix, pelvic floor, and pelvic walls, causing the head to flex so that the chin is brought into contact with the chest. This results in the smallest anteroposterior diameter of the fetal head (suboccipitobregmatic diameter: 9.5 cm) to present into the maternal pelvis.
4. **Internal Rotation**: this mechanism involves the turning of the fetal head from left to right, aligning it with the long axis of the maternal pelvis and causing the occiput to move anteriorly toward the symphysis pubis.
	- In internal rotation, the fetal skull rotates from transverse to anteroposterior at the pelvic outlet, which is associated with descent.
	- After internal rotation, the occiput is just under the symphysis pubis.
	- Not accomplished until the head is engaged; occurs mainly during the second stage of labor.
5. **Extension**: the delivery of the head in vertex presentation, or when the head leaves the pelvic outlet.
	- There is a gradual emergence of the occiput just under the symphysis pubis, followed by the face and then the chin.
>[!TODO] Meconium Aspiration
>As soon as the head is out, even before the chest is born, the mouth and then the nose are wiped clear of secretions to prevent meconium aspiration. Routine suctioning of the newborn is no longer performed in the immediate care of the newborn.
6. **Restitution**: after the head is extended, the neck is twisted, so the head needs to externally rotate to realign with the long axis of the fetus.
7. **External Rotation**: as a continuation of restitution, the shoulders align with the anteroposterior diameter, causing the fetal head to continue to rotate. The trunk navigates through the pelvic cavity, with the anterior shoulder descending first.
8. **Expulsion**: final birth of the baby. A gentle but firm downward pressure/traction of the head is done to deliver the anterior shoulder. Then, the head is gently raised to deliver the posterior shoulder, and the entire body follows without much difficulty. The head is the biggest part of the baby; after the head passes out, the rest of the body follows with no difficulty.
	- When the entire body of the baby emerges from the birth canal, birth is complete. The time of birth is recorded and entered in the birth certificate.
	- Apply *Unang Yakap* or the [[#Essential Newborn Care]] (ENC) protocol if part of the institutional practice.
>[!DANGER] Contact the Healthcare Provider or Go to the Hospital
>9. When **contractions are regular and becoming increasingly frequent**: their duration is 30 seconds and they occur every 5 minutes.
>10. When **show** is present.
>11. When **the bag of water ruptures**. The rupture of the bag of water is always an indication for seeking medical help.

# Stages of Labor
## Dilatation Stage
The **Dilatation Stage** begins with the onset of the first true labor contraction up to full cervical dilatation (10 cm). Power comes from uterine contractions. This stage is further subdivided into three phases:

|               | Latent                                          | Active                                                                                                                              | Transition                                                                                                                                                                             |

Every pregnancy and birth is unique, so the best intrapartum care for each woman and her baby is individualized, person-centered, respectful, and evidence-based. In the first stage of labor upon admission to the labor unit, greet the patient, admit and orient them to the physical setting and common procedures, and take their history (GPTPALM, EDC/EDD, last meal, allergies, onset of labor, status of bag of waters, intent to breastfeed). Assess their knowledge about labor and preparedness. Take initial vital signs and FHT.
- Perform [[CMPA/RPS MNC/05#Complete Physical Examination|Leopold's Maneuver]]. Remember to **empty the bladder**, flex the knees, and warm hands.
- Do perineal preparation; observe the principles of asepsis.
- Render an enema **only if ordered**. Removal as a routine procedure reduces infection, labor retardation, and postpartum discomfort.
- Obtain specimens for laboratory: urine (sugar, protein, acetone) and blood (Hgb, Hct, WBC, serology, cross-matching).

**Monitor for uterine contractions**, the bladder, FHT, perineum (**Show**), rupture of BOW, presenting part, bulging, cord prolapse, bleeding; ability to manage pain.
- BP, PR, and RR every hour in the latent and active phases, and every 30 minutes in the transition phase (if normal).
- Temperature every 4 hours (if normal), and hourly if above 37.5°C or if membranes rupture (leading complication of prolonged rupture of the bag of water is infection).
- FHR: every 30 minutes in the latent phase, every 15 minutes after (if normal).

Prevent **supine hypotensive syndrome**. Position the patient in a **left lateral recumbent** position. Employ physical and psychologic comfort and support; comfort measures such as assisting with positional change, keeping clean and dry, and promoting sleep and adequate rest are observed.
- **Distraction** is one of the methods used to increase relaxation and cope with the discomfort of labor when contractions are mild to moderate. Examples include "*happy thoughts*", conversation, light activities (reading, card play, ambulation), and visualization.
- **Massages**, particularly **effleurage**, is a light abdominal stroking, which may be used in the first stage to maintain relaxation of the abdominal muscle; effective for mild to moderate pain.
- **Back ache** is particularly severe in occipitoposterior positions. Pain may be relieved by counter-sacral pressure and a side-lying position.

>[!DANGER] Always watch for **DANGER SIGNALS**
>1. **Hypertonic or hypotonic contractions**
>2. **Bleeding** (placenta previa, abruptio placenta, uterine rupture)
>3. **Passing of meconium-stained amniotic fluid** (fetal distress)
>4. **Severe headache, dizziness, and blurring of vision** (PIH)
## Delivery/Expulsion Stage
The **Delivery/Expulsion Stage** lasts from full cervical dilatation to the delivery or expulsion of the baby. This stage features the inclusion of **secondary powers** (maternal pushing, intraabdominal pressure) in the birthing process.
>[!TIP] Pushing in the Crowning Stage
>**Pushing** spontaneously occurs with contractions, but **panting** should be done during interval and at crowning time. **Crowning** is the hallmark of the second stage. At this period, pushing is not recommended as the fetus undergoes **extension**, and alteration with pushing can cause **perineal lacerations**, and **meconium aspiration**.

- The strength, duration, and frequency of contractions do not vary from the transition phase.
- The perineum bulges; the mother grunts when pushing. There is an increase in **show**, leg cramps can occur, and the **bag of water ruptures**. This stage is the best time for rupture. **The first nursing action after rupturing is to check the FHT**.
### Nursing Implementation
1. **Continue to offer a psychological support** and **inform the mother of progress**. Use (*mn. PRAISE*) **Praise**, **Reassurance**, **Encouragement**, **Informing** the mother of progress, **Support System** (COC), and **Therapeutic Touch**.
2. **Assist/Coach through labor**, about when to push or to pant.
3. **Monitor FHT** during intervals (period of rest). If there is a continuous fetal heart electronic monitor, check the FHT during and after a contraction. **Be alert for late decelerations**.
4. **Transfer the mother to the delivery room**. For primigravidas, with slower progress of labor, they are transferred at 10 cm of dilatation with a certain degree of bulging with contractions. For multigravidas, they are transferred at 8 to 9 cm.
5. **Positioning**: **lithotomy** with padded, equal stirrups, with no pressure on the popliteal region. The legs are placed on the stirrups simultaneously. Alternatively, Fowler's, side-lying, or squatting can be used if desired, indicated, or supported by the unit policy.
6. **Perineal Preparation**: cleaning of the perineum to prepare for delivery. A front-to-back motion is used.

## Placental Stage
The **Placental Stage** is the period from the delivery of the baby to the delivery of the placenta. The powers involved in the delivery of placental delivery is from strong uterine contractions, and maybe maternal pushing once the placenta has fully detached. There are four primary **signs of placental separation**:
1. **Calkin's sign**: the first sign; when the uterus changes shape (from discoid to globular) and consistency (becomes firm).
2. **Uterine mobility**: the uterus rises up into the abdomen. Immediately after placental detachment, the fundus is midway between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus, then rises to the level of the umbilicus.
3. **Sudden gushing of blood** from the open blood vessels once connected to the placenta. It is important to distinguish between the normal sudden gushing of blood, and the abnormal "increasing bleeding".
4. **Slight lengthening of the cord**: the **most definitive** sign that the placenta has detached.

The placental delivery can be typed according to which side of the placenta appears first:
1.  **Schultze Mechanism**: more common; present in 80% of cases. The **shiny**, "**clean**", **bluish** side is first delivered. Less external bleeding occurs because blood is usually concealed *behind* the placenta. The separation for the placenta in this type starts with the middle, then to the edges, which gives it an "inverted umbrella" appearance.
2. **Matthew Duncan Mechanism**: present in the remaining 20% of cases. The **rough**, "**dirty**", **reddish** side is first delivered. More external bleeding occurs, giving the delivery a "*bloody*" appearance. The separation for the placenta in this type starts with the side, giving it an "umbrella" appearance.
>[!WARNING] Postpartal Hemorrhage
>The normal amount of blood lost in the entire process of delivery is 250 to 300 mL. Blood loss of more than 500 mL is considered **postpartal hemorrhage**, the leading cause of maternal mortality.
### Nursing Implementation
Observe the principles of the placental delivery stage:
- **Watchful Waiting** (watch and wait for signs of placental separation)
- **Not Increasing Fundal Pressure** with a pull at the cord, especially if the uterus is relaxed, as these actions could cause **uterine inversion**, a leading cause of hemorrhage in the third stage of labor.
- **Gradual Delivery of the Placenta**
- Inspect the placenta for **completeness**. The major components of a placenta are **cotyledons** (15 to 20), **cord vessels** (two arteries and one vein), and **complete membranes**. This ensures the reduction of potential placental fragment retention, causing hemorrhaging.

**Assess the uterus for contraction or firmness**. The terms "soft," "boggy," and "non-palpable" mean **uterine atony**. The initial activity of the nurse is to **massage the fundus until it is firm**. An ice cap may be applied to further contract the uterus, but **never a hot water bag**. This promotes vasodilation, increasing bleeding.

**Oxytocin** is ordered by the physician and administered by the nurse **after placental delivery**. Commonly used drugs include **methergine** (Methylergonovine maleate) and **ergotrate** (Ergonovine maleate/Ergometrine). These increase uterine motor activity by direct stimulation of the uterine musculature. Contraction prevents postpartum bleeding from uterine atony and subinvolution. **Evaluate for a firm fundus** to determine effectivity. This may cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, hypertension, tinnitus, and hypersensitivity.

After the birthing process, assess vital signs, presence of lacerations, completeness of the placenta, and bleeding. Lower legs slowly. If allowed by the institution, allow mother time with the infant to promote attachment or bonding; breastfeed right on the delivery table.
## Recovery
The **Recovery Stage** is the period of recovery, stabilization, or homeostasis; usually 1 to 2 hours or at most up to 4 hours. Power still remains from uterine contractions that prevent bleeding from the placental site.
- **Vital signs every 15 minutes**. Blood loss averages 250 mL during delivery. A normal upper limit is 500 mL. More than this amount is defined as postpartum bleeding.
	- **Blood pressure changes** (lower in both systolic and diastolic, increased pulse pressure, slight to moderate tachycardia) occur from blood loss, lifting of the uterus, and redistribution of blood to the venous beds.
- **Palpate the fundus** every 15 minutes. Check **fundal height** and **position** in relation to the umbilicus, and its **consistency**. In a normal delivery during the recovery stage, **the fundus is firm**, **midline**, and **at the level of the umbilicus**.
	- Ask the mother to **void** prior to any palpation. This promotes maternal comfort and improves finding accuracy from palpation.
	- **Displacement of the uterus to the side** is often due to a distended bladder. Palpate the lower abdomen for a distended bladder, and if it is, stimulate voiding. Displacement can contribute to uterine atony.
- **Assess Lochia**. Lochia is **bright-red** during the fourth stage, and can saturate one to two pads in one hour. A reddish color may be maintained for two weeks, but longer periods indicates either **retention of small portions of the placenta** or **imperfect involution of the placental site**, or both.

- **Assess the perineum**. Note its general appearance, redness, swelling, bruising, and vaginal and suture line bleeding.
- **Administer oxytocin medication** as ordered. Check blood pressure before and at intervals after; monitor fundal contraction and lochia after administration.
- **Check the episiotomy wound or lacerated wound** for bleeding, hematoma, or edema. An ice bag applied to the perineum immediately after delivery (and in the first 24 hours) can reduce edema and swelling.
- **Promote sleep and comfort**. Keep the mother warm, as chills are common in the fourth stage. This may be due to maternal excitement, a sudden drop in maternal hormones (progesterone is thermogenic), the release of intra-abdominal pressure, and fetal blood in circulation.
	- Perform a partial bath and peri-care (front to back), and changing wet linens.
- **Assess for afterpains**; pains that occur upon uterine contraction. Reassure that these are secondary to uterine contractions. An icecap may be placed on the abdomen overlying the fundus for relief, or analgesics may be given as ordered.
- **Provide nourishment**. The mother may be thirsty and hungry.
>[!SUCCESS] Always Provide **Respectful Care**
>Remember that the care of maternity clients should always be **respectful**. Respectful intrapartum care maintains women's dignity, privacy, and confidentiality, ensuring freedom from harm and mistreatment, and enabling informed choice during labor and childbirth. This WHO model of intrapartum care provides a basis for empowering all women to access and demand the type of care that they want and need (WHO, 2020c).
