# Power
1. **Uterine Contractions**: the primary power of labor. An involuntary, rhythmical, regular activity of uterine musculature. It occurs intermittently by allowing for a period of uterine relaxation between contractions; uterine and maternal rest and restoration of uteroplacental circulation; sustained fetal oxygenation. This propels the presenting part downward or forward, and aids in progressing dilatation and effacement.
	- Contractions increase maternal BP due to increased peripheral arteriole pressure. Measurement of BP should be between contractions to gain accurate results.
	- Myometrial contractions constrict blood vessels, decreasing uteroplacental circulation. As such, prolonged uterine contractions can cause fetal hypoxia.
	- **Contractions can be graphed into three parts**, and have relevant durations, intervals, and frequency:
		- **Increment**: increasing or "building up" contraction; the first and longest phase.
		- **Acme**: the apex, height, or peak of the uterine contractions.
		- **Decrement**: the phase of decreasing contraction; "letting up". The last/end phase.
		- **Duration**: the period from increment to decrement. Measured in seconds.
			- Contractions lasting more than 90 seconds can lead to fetal distress, and is called a **tetanic contraction**.
		- **Interval**: the period from the end to the start of another contraction. It is the uterine resting time, and should be at least 1 minute, not less than 30 to 45 seconds. It is measured in minutes.
		- **Frequency**: the period from the start of one contraction to the start of the next contraction. It is effectively duration plus the interval. Measured in minutes.

>[!INFO] Palpation of Contractions
>Place the hand lightly on the fundus with the fingers spread; described as mild, moderate and strong by judging the degree of indentability/depressability of the uterine wall during acme. If indentation is not possible, the contraction is **strong**; difficulty, **moderate**; and **mild** if tense but easily indented.
>- An intrauterine catheter can be used to directly measure the strength of contractions. At acme, intensity ranges from 30 mm Hg to 55 mm Hg of pressure. The resting tonus average is 10 mm Hg. A major disadvantage of this method involves the requirement of a ruptured bag of water and invasiveness.

2. **Secondary Powers**: **maternal bearing down**/**pushing**. Only done on full dilation (10 cm), and a fetal station of +1 (able to stimulate the Ferguson reflex, which is triggered by pressure on the pelvic floor).
	- Bearing down should not be done prior to full dilation due to the risk of lacerations.
	- Teach the mother to take a deep breath as soon as the next contraction begins, and then, with breath held, exert a downward pressure exactly as though she were straining at the stool. She should not hold her breath for longer than six seconds, during pushing. Involuntary pushing, grunting, groaning, exhaling, or breath-holding for less than seconds is supported. She should push four or more pushes per contraction.

# Passageway
Divided between the **soft passages**: cervix, vagina, and perineum (potentially lacerated) and **bony passages**: the **pelvis**. Problems of the bony pelvis that can influence the progress of labor include heredity, a contracted pelvis due to avitaminosis D or rickets in childhood, infection, accidents, and cephalo-pelvic disproportion (CPD), the leading cause of primary cesarean section.

# Psyche
A pregnant woman's general behavior and influences on her also affect labor progress. Some factors that make labor meaningful, positive or negative, even:
- **Cultural influences** integrating maternal attitudes; how a particular society views childbirth
- **Expectations and goals for the labor process**, whether realistic, achievable, or otherwise
- **Feedback** from other people participating in the birthing process.

This also includes the pregnant woman's psychologic response to uterine contractions; **fear and anxiety** affect labor progress. A woman who is relaxed, aware of, and participating in the birth process usually has a shorter, less intensive labor.

**Pain**, and **anticipation of pain** can increase emotional tension and increase pain perception. Even though perceptions of childbirth pain are greatly influenced by a lot of factors, such as psychosocial factors, there is a physiologic basis for discomfort during labor.
1. **First Stage of Labor**: distention and dilatation of the cervix is the primary source of pain in the first stage. Pain from the uterus is referred to as dermatoses supplied by the 12th, 11th, and 10th thoracic nerves, with referred pain to the lower abdominal wall and the areas over the lower lumbar region and upper sacrum. Thus, the characteristic sign of pain in true labor is **lumbosacral radiating to the abdomen**.
	- Hypoxia of the uterine muscles during contraction also cause pain.
	- Distension and stretching of the lower uterine segment in combination with isometric contraction of the uterus: if the fetus is large, there is more stretching of the lower uterine segment and more pressure on adjacent structures, causing more pain.
	- Pressure on adjacent structures.
2. **Second Stage of Labor**: tissue damage in the pelvis and perineum, ischemia/hypoxia of contracting uterine muscles, distention of the vagina and perineum, and pressure on adjacent structures.
	- Distention of the vagina and perineum: the nerve impulses travel via the pudendal nerve plexus and enter the spinal cord through the posterior roots of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves. As such, the **pudendal block technique** is employed, relieving pain from perineal distention (but not uterine contractions).
	- Pressure on adjacent structures: the larger the passenger, the harder the compressing part (fetal occiput in occipitoposterior positions), and the longer the time of pressure on adjacent structures (prolonged contractions); thus, the more pain and discomfort is experienced by the parturient.

Other factors include:
1. **Childbirth preparation process** (classes): considered a valuable tranquilizer during the birth process; could decrease the need for analgesics in labor.
2. **Support system**: the husband's (or **companion of choice**) presence in the labor and delivery unit, the nurse's supportive and caring environment, and therapeutic communication all contribute to the support a mother receives during labor and delivery.
3. **Previous experiences**
