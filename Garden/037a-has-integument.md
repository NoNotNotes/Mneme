The integument includes the skin, hair, and nails. The examination begins with a generalized inspection using a good source of lighting, preferably indirect natural daylight.

# Skin
**Skin**: inspection (sight, smell) and palpation.
1. Pungent body odor related to poor hygiene, hyperhidrosis, or bromhidrosis.
2. **Pallor**: paleness due to inadequate circulating blood. This is most readily seen in areas of least pigmentation such as the conjunctiva, oral mucous membranes, nail beds, palms of the hand, and soles of the feet. In **dark/black skin**, it appears *ashen gray*. In **brown skin**, it may appear as a *yellowish brown tinge*.
3. **Cyanosis**: a bluish tinge most evident in the nail beds, lips, and buccal mucosa. The palpebral conjunctiva, palms, and soles are used to determine the presence of cyanosis in dark-skinned clients.
4. **Jaundice**: a yellowish tinge commonly first evident in the sclera of the eyes and then in the mucous membranes and the skin. Take care not to confuse the normal yellow tinged sclera that may be present in some dark skinned clients-- if suspected, observe for jaundice at the **posterior hard palate** in clients to verify the presence of jaundice.
5. **Erythema**: skin redness associated with a variety of rashes and other conditions.
6. **Hyper-** and **hypopigmentation**: changes in the distribution of melanin or in the function of the melanocytes in the epidermis. Examples include birthmarks or vitiligo. Albinism is the complete or partial lack of melanin in the skin, hair, and eyes. It may also point to problems, such as edema or a localized infection.
7. **Edema**: the presence of excess interstitial fluid. It appears swollen, shiny, and taut and tends to blanch the skin color or, if accompanied by inflammation, may redden the skin. Generalized edema (anasarca) is most often an indication of impaired venous circulation and in some cases reflect cardiac dysfunction or venous abnormalities.
8. **Skin lesions**: alterations in a client's normal skin appearance either as **primary lesions** (due to changes in the external or internal environment of the skin) or **secondary lesions** that result from chronicity, trauma, or infection of the primary lesion.
	- Describe lesions in terms of location, distribution, configuration, color, shape, size, firmness, texture, and characteristics of individual lesions.

# Hair
Assessing a client's hair includes inspecting the hair, considering developmental changes and ethnic differences, and determining the individual's hair care practices and factors influencing them. Much of the information about hair can be obtained by questioning the client.
1. Hair is normally **resilient** and **evenly distributed**.
2. **Faded** or even **reddish or bleached** dry, coarse hair can result from severe protein deficiency (kwashiorkor).
3. **Thin and brittle** hair can appear in hypothyroidism.
4. **Alopecia** can occur in some therapies.
___
# Nails
Inspect for shape, angle between the fingernail and nail bed, nail texture, nail bed color, and the intactness of tissues around the nails. Nails are normally colorless and has a convex curve; the angle between the nail bed and fingernail is 160 degrees.
1. **Koilonychia**: spoon-shaped nails, seen in patients with iron-deficiency anemia.
2. **Clubbing**: the angle of the nail and nail bed increases to 180 degrees or greater, potentially caused by a long-term lack of oxygen.
3. **Thick Nails**: excessively thick nails can be seen in older adults, due to poor circulation, or in relation to a chronic fungal infection.
4. **Thin Nails**: grooves or furrows due to prolonged iron-deficiency anemia can make the nail appear thin.
	- **Beau's Lines** are horizontal depressions in the nail that can result from injury or severe illness.
5. **Discolored Nail Beds**: nails are highly vascular, a characteristic that accounts for its color. Cyanosis and pallor are easily observed through the nail beds.
6. **Onychomycosis** (nail fungus) should be referred to a podiatrist or dermatologist for treatment of nail fungus. Symptoms include brittleness, discoloration, thickening, distortion of nail shape, crumbling of the nail, and loosening of the nail.
7. **Paronychia**: inflammation of the tissues surrounding a nail. Inflammation, swelling, and tenderness are usually present.
8. **Slow Capillary Refill** is reflective of perfusion, and is observed with the **blanch test**-- the application of pressure to blanch the nail bed, after which they should quickly turn pink (or their usual color) when pressure is released.
