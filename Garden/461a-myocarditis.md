Inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart. Abnormal function resulting from inflammation reduces CO and predisposes the client to CHF. Ischemia of the myocardium results in tachycardia and dysrhythmias.
- Viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic **infection**.
- **Chronic alcohol and cocaine abuse**
- Secondary to **Radiation Therapy**
- **Autoimmune Disorders**
- Bulimic patients **abusing Ipecac Syrup** to induce vomiting, causing myocardial damage.
- May be idiopathic.
- Its complication is **cardiomyopathy**, where myocardial dilation and hypertrophy occurs, which ends up in decompensation.
___
# Assessment
- Pain, Fever, Tachycardia, Dysrhythmias, Dyspnea, Malaise, Fatigue, Anorexia, Pallor/Cyanosis, RSHF Symptoms
- Increased WBC, Elevated CRP, Elevated Cardiac Enzymes, Abnormal ECG
- **CXR** and **ECHO** reveals cardiomegaly
- Most definitive: **endomyocardial biopsy** for testing
___
# Intervention
- Treatment of underlying cause (**antibiotics** if m.o.)
- **Bed rest**, **Na<sup>+</sup> restriction**, **Cardiotonic Drugs** (Digitalis)
- **Monitor**:
	- Cardiopulmonary status and complications (CHF, Dysrhythmias)
	- Vital Signs, Daily Weight, I&O
	- Heart and Lung Sounds
	- Pulse Oximetry
	- Cardiac Monitoring
	- **Dependent Edema**
