The most diabetogenic hormone of pregnancy is **Human Placental Lactogen** (HPL) from the placenta. HPL production in pregnant women start to increase by **the sixth month of pregnancy**, the best time for screening for GDM.
___
# Diagnosis
1. **Glucose Challenge Test** (GCT) is the screening test, and requires **no special preparations**. It involves the administration of 50 grams of glucose solution, and one blood extraction an hour after administration.
	- Normal result: **<145 mg/dL**. If this is exceeded, the client must undergo an oral glucose tolerance test.
2. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test** (OGTT) is the confirmatory test, and requires **two days of increased carbohydrate intake** followed by **NPO post-midnight** the day before the exam. Fasting blood sugar is checked and 100 grams of glucose solution is administered, followed by three consecutive blood extractions one hour, two hours, and three hours after the administration.
	- Normal **FBS**: <90 mg/dL
	- Normal result **1 hour after** administration: <180 mg/dL
	- Normal result **2 hours after** administration: <155 mg/dL
	- Normal result **3 hours after** administration: <145 mg/dL
	- If **two of the four results are abnormal**, GDM is diagnosed. If one is abnormal, a **repeat test is done**. If only one is still abnormal, GDM is negative.

| **Follow-up**      | If abnormal, proceed to OGTT | If 2 of 4 are abnormal, confirmation; if only 1 of 4, repeat.                                                                |

# Assessment Findings
The classical signs of diabetes are present: **polyphagia**, **polydipsia**, **polyuria**. Polyhydramnios may also occur due to the osmotic effect of glucose.
- Insulin function is blocked by HPL. The hyperglycemia results in fluid shifting
- **Polyuria** results from **increased kidney perfusion** as a result of fluid shifting.
- Shrinkage of the cells (cellular dehydration) results in **polydipsia**
- Cellular starvation results in **polyphagia**, which may result in further hyperglycemia.
- Cellular starvation leads to initiation of gluconeogenesis, which produces ketone bodies (that accumulate in the brain, resulting in decreased level of consciousness, and urine), resulting in **diabetic ketoacidosis**, then diabetic coma.
- Ketones may also cross the placenta, absorbed by the fetal blood then body and brain (fetal acidosis), causing **permanent cognitive impairment**.
- Hyperglycemia results in fetal pancreatic hyperinsulinemia and a macrosomic fetus (>4000 grams) that experiences **neonatal hypoglycemia** (indicated by jitteriness)
	-  40 to 60 mg/dL: normal value
	- <40 to <35 mg/dL: assess neonatal **sucking ability**; if absent, prepare **IV Glucose Solution**, otherwise, provide **oral glucose solution** (Oresol)
	- 35 mg/dL: **IV Glucose Solution**
___
# Management
1. **Diet**: diabetic exchange diet, balancing meal proportions to manage glucose levels. The patient must consult with a dietitian.
2. **Exercise**: walking is the best exercise. Prior to the exercise, sustaining carbohydrates are required to prevent sudden hypoglycemia.
3. **Insulin**: two types may be added into one insulin syringe (orange hub).
4. **Self-administration health education**:
	- Asepsis; what parts of the syringe not to touch, and how to perform handwashing
	- Sites of administration: subcutaneous; upper arm, abdomen, thigh, buttocks in 9 or 12 sites **two fingerbreadths** away from the umbilicus. avoid injection of insulin in the same site due to lipodystrophy.
5. **Early delivery** may be done for diabetic pregnant women with **poor glycemic control**. As early as 6 weeks (when surfactant production begins), dexamethasone or betamethasone may be given to improve surfactant production for birth.

| Insulin Type                  | Examples             | Onset                   | Peak         | Duration       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Short-Acting (Regular, Clear) | Humulin R, Novolin R | 30 minutes - 60 minutes | 2 to 4 hours | 6 to 8 hours   |
| Intermediate (Cloudy)         | NPH                  | 2 hours                 | 6 to 8 hours | 12 to 18 hours |

>[!TIP] Mixed Insulin Aspiration
>The clear (Regular) insulin is aspirated first to prevent contamination of the short-acting insulin with the long-acting insulin. Contamination of regular with intermediate results in changes in **duration**, while contamination of intermediate of regular results in changes in **onset**. Changes in duration results in prolonged hypoglycemia, and is a considerable problem. An earlier onset of intermediate insulin is not a cause of concern.

Provide maternal and fetal monitoring:
1. Maternal **glucose levels**
2. Maternal **blood pressure**
3. Maternal **weight monitoring**
4. **Ultrasound** to detect **LGA**
5. Fetal **kick count**: normally 5 to 15, average 10.
6. **Chorionic Villi Sampling** for detecting chromosomal defects by week **10 to 12**.
7. **Maternal Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein** for detecting chromosomal defects and neural tube defects by week **14 to 16**.
	- Normal findings: **38 to 42 ng/dL**. A deficiency may indicate chromosomal defects, while an excess may indicate neural tube defects.
