**Labor** may be induced, most often for **post term** babies via the use of **oxytocic** drugs. **Augmentation of labor** enhances labor in the cases of **hypotonic contractions**; **prolonged labor**. To determine the readiness of the woman for induction or augmentation, **Bishop scoring** is used.
## Bishop Scoring
The lowest score is 0, and the highest score is 13 (3, 3, 3, 2, 2). **A score of 8 or above permits for induction/augmentation**. Lower than 8, the doctor is not allowed to induce/augment labor.

| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Cervical Dilatation**  | 0         | 1-2        | 3-4        | 5-6            |
| **Cervical Effacement**  | 0% to 30% | 40% to 50% | 60% to 70% | 80% or greater |
| **Fetal Station**        | -3        | -2         | -1 to 0    | +1 to +2       |
| **Cervical Consistency** | Firm      | Medium     | Soft       | ---            |
| **Cervical Position**    | Posterior | Middle     | Anterior   | ---            |
- **Determining Consistency**: Firm (like tip of nose), Medium (like earlobe), Soft (like lips)
	- The medicine used to "ripen" the cervix (induce Goodell's sign) is a **prostaglandin gel**.
	- If ineffective, **Cytotec** is used: a scored tablet with 100 mcg, usually administered as 1/4th of a tablet (25 mcg)
	- If dilatation remains slow, a **Laminaria Tent** may be used. It is a dried, sterile, cone-shaped seaweed inserted into the cervix, where it absorbs cervical mucus and expands, facilitating dilatation.
- **Determining Position**: Posteriorly Positioned (cervix pointing to anus), Middle (straight), Anteriorly Positioned (cervix pointing to clitoris)
