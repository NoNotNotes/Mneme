**Traumatic head injury** is the leading cause of death and disability from ages 1 to 44, at an annual rate of ~52,000 deaths due to TBI, with two-thirds of that population being men. It is caused by an external mechanical force and may result in permanent or temporary impairment of cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functions, with an associated diminished or altered state of consciousness. These forces may occur from falls, collisions (vehicles, other moving objects such as a baseball), violence (gunshots, abuse, shaken baby syndrome), sports injuries, etc.

>[!EXAMPLE] Types of TBI
>1. **Closed**: the skull is not broken; the brain is not exposed. This may be due to rapid movement such as in sudden accelerations or decelerations. Depending on which region the brain hits, this may be considered as a coup (frontal) contusion from deceleration or sudden hyperextension of the head, or contrecoup (occipital) contusion from acceleration or sudden hyperflexion of the head.
>2. **Open**: a penetrating head injury which may be focal (isolated to one area) or diffuse (widespread).

The damage caused by a traumatic brain injury, i.e. it's **pathophysiology**, begins with the **primary injury**, literally the damage caused by the trauma at the moment of injury. The **secondary injury** is the damage produced after the initial trauma, such as rebound contusions (the brain bounces back onto the contrecoup after hitting the coup), swelling, increased ICP, hypoxia, etc.
1. **Primary Brain Damage**: due to two main mechanisms (a) contact, e.g. an object striking the head producing fractures or contusions, and (b) change in momentum, i.e. sudden acceleration and deceleration producing shear, tensile, and compressive strains on the brain. These may result in **intracranial hematoma** (most common cause of death in TBI), **diffuse vascular injury**, and **injury to the cranial nerves and pituitary stalk**.
>[!WARNING] Intracranial Hemorrhage
>An intracranial hemorrhage is classified according to its location:
>2. **Epidural Hematoma**: bleeding from a fracture of the temporal bone and rupture of the middle meningeal artery.
>3. **Subdural Hematoma**: bleeding from ruptured bridging veins in the subdural space.
>4. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**: bleeding from damage to blood vessels in the posterior fossa stalk.
>5. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**: bleeding within the brain
>6. **Intraventricular Hemorrhage**: bleeding into the ventricles of the brain

7. *Secondary Brain Injury**: occurring hours or days after the initial injury, this may result from **impairment in cerebral blood flow** due to local edema, hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure such, shock, disturbance of pulmonary ventilation (aspiration, chest wall instability, neurogenic disturbance), etc.
	- Decreased perfusion results in cellular destruction, causing neuronal death.
## Clinical Manifestations
1. **Cognitive Changes**: change in level of consciousness (loss of consciousness, speech, lethargy, attention deficit, mood disturbances), memory, learning, problem-solving, speed of mental processing, judgment, and decision-making.
	- Attention deficits, changes in sleep habits, and mood disturbances may be found in children with TBI, along with changes in eating habits and persistent, inconsolable crying.
2. **Physical Changes**: weakness or numbness in the extremities; persistent, potentially worsening headache, spasticity, physical paralysis, chronic pain, changes in sensorium, loss of stamina, and loss of control of the bowel and bladder.

Categorized into severity of TBI:
1. **Mild TBI**: loss of consciousness for seconds to minutes, problems with memory or concentration, headache, dizziness/loss of balance, nausea/vomiting, and difficulty sleeping
2. **Moderate to Severe TBI**: loss of consciousness for minutes to hours, problems with speech, inability to awaken from sleep, weakness or numbness in the extremities or digits, loss of coordination (ataxia), and persistent, worsening headache.

>[!BUG] Posturing
>Individuals with severely injury may experience **decorticate** or **decerebrate posturing**:
>1. **Decorticate**: the arms are **rigidly flexed** at the elbows and wrists, with the legs possible flexed with the toes rigidly pointed. This indicates a **lesion in the brain**, and may sometimes be produced by applying a painful stimulus to a comatose patient. In Glasgow's coma scale, this finding would be rated as a 3/6 on the motor scale.
>2. **Decerebrate**: the arms are **rigidly straight and internally rotated**. The legs are extended with the toes rigidly pointed. This is usually observed in patients afflicted by **compression of the brain stem at a low level**. In Glasgow's coma scale, this finding would be rated as a 2/6 on the motor scale.

>The progression of a patient from a decorticate posture to a decerebrate posture indicates **worsening** of their condition, as reflected by Glasgow's coma scale.
## Complications
An altered level of consciousness is highly representative of worsening conditions in the brain for a patient with traumatic brain injury. These may appear in varying degrees:
1. **Coma**: the person is fully unconscious, resulting from widespread damage to all parts of the brain. It may take days to weeks for a person to emerge from a coma, after which they may still remain in a vegetative state.
2. **Vegetative State**: a potentially permanent state wherein individuals are physically awake, but show no signs of cognition.
3. **Minimally Conscious State**: a severely altered level of consciousness but with some evidence of self and environmental awareness.
4. **Locked-In Syndrome**: a condition where an individual's consciousness is intact, but they are unable to speak or move, often only being able to communicate with eye movement or blinking.

Other complications include :
1. **Infections**, a consistent problem in patients with skull fractures or other openings or entry points.
2. **Blood Vessel Damage** from the injury, which can result in strokes or clotting.
3. **Nerve Damage**, specifically the cranial nerves that arise directly from the brain, can result in facial paralysis, loss of vision, and dysfunction related to other cranial nerves.
## Management
**Operative management is not used to correct brain injury**. It is only used to address (a) the need for **ICP monitoring** with a bolt or other device, (b) **bleeding** within the brain; surgical removal or drainage may be necessary, and (c) **removal of skull bone fragments/damaged tissue** and **repair of skull fractures** if present in open head injuries.

**Pharmacologic management** may be used for the following:

| Indication                                    | Treatment                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Increased intracranial pressure               | **Diuresis**                                                                                            |
| Seizure activity                              | **Anti-seizure drugs**. This is used **prophylactically** during the first week of management.          |
| **Medical induction of a coma**               | Done to reduce the oxygen demands of the brain, reducing the potential for cell death in hypoperfusion. |
| **Problems with attention and concentration** | **Amantadine**, **Methylphenidate**, **Bromocriptine**, **Antidepressants**                             |
