# Theories in Leadership
- **Great Man Theory**: the prospect that leaders are **born**; that experience is less significant in what makes an individual a good leader. The characteristics of a leader are inherent and is not something that can be developed easily.
- **Trait Theory**: certain traits, such as personality, intelligence, and abilities, make a leader. Individuals should strive to attain and develop these traits to become an excellent leader.
- **Charismatic Theory**: the driving force of leadership is **charisma**.
- **Situational Theory**: the greatest leader depends on the contexts and attributes of the situation; leadership is a "*case-by-case*" basis.
- **Vroom-Yetton Expectancy Theory**: a model of decision-making where the leader determines the amount of participation by followers depending on the situation.
- **Contingency Theory**: the most appropriate leadership style is contingent on situational factors.
- **Transformational Leadership Theory**: the utilization of **group empowerment** to allow for success.
- **Transactional Leadership Theory**: the utilization of **policies, rules, or other written documents** for objectives. Performance is important and rewarded or sanctioned.
- **Fielder's Theory**: the style utilized by a leader must match the situation it is being used in. (to-do: differentiate from contingency theory)
- **Path-Goal Theory**: the leader is the one to set a path and traverse it along with his followers in achieving a goal, e.g., setting clear directions for a certain objective.
# Leadership Styles
1. **Authoritarian**; **Autocratic**; **Dictatorial**; "**Hard**" **Leadership**: a leadership style that focuses all power towards those in authority or higher positions. Decision-making is done without the influence of the followers or members of the group.
	- Leaders that utilize this style are often **task-oriented** and **insensitive**, and subject to dissatisfaction. They often display characteristics like a commanding, boisterous voice; a unilateral approach; a demanding attitude; a hostile personality; exploitative means; and demands no inputs or intervention from others.
	- This style may only become effective in emergent situations.
2. **Permissive**; **Ultra-liberal**; **Laissez-Faire**; "**Free-rein**" **Leadership**: a leadership style opposite to a hard leadership, where freedom is freely given to the group, and results are often poor. Decision-making is light on all members of the team and no single individual holds initiative for action.
	- Leaders that utilize this style receive criticism for not taking on major responsibilities, and members often exercise vast and even leadership functions to compensate.
	- This style is dangerous in health care settings because of the risk of malpractice. It may only be utilized if all members of the team are well-trained or skilled.
3. **Democratic**; **Participative Leadership**: the "*mutual*" style, where the leader exercises his powers and control to all members but allows for the participation of subordinates in the decision-making process. In this style, both the goals of the group and the welfare of its members are valued.
	- This style of leadership is highly valuable as it allows for highly flexible and cohesive group functioning.
