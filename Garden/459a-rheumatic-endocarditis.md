Inflammation that follows an URTI (tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis) caused by GABHS. When the heart becomes affected, it becomes "*Rheumatic Carditis*/*Endocarditis*".
- Antibodies are formed to destroy GABHS, which cross-react to proteins found in the connective tissues of the heart, joints, skin, and nervous system.
- This may result in **Pancarditis**, inflammation of all layers of the heart including valvulitis.
- WBCs migrate to the endocardium where the inflammation is, which end up accumulating inflammatory debris (dead cells from phagocytosis) called "*vegetations*" around the valve leaflets, which can cause obstruction in blood flow (circulatory stasis).
- The **vegetations or thrombi formed from obstruction may embolize** and settle in any part of the body.
- **Atrial fibrillation** may result from the vegetations.
___
# Assessment
## Major/Classic Symptoms
(Separate manifestations of the autoimmune reaction towards the heart, joints, nervous system, and skin)
- **Carditis**: characterized by the formation of **Aschoff's Bodies**, **Murmurs**, and a **Pericardial Friction Rub**, which may result in **CHF**.
- **Polyarthritis**: swelling of multiple joints that is warm, red, and painful.
- **Chorea** (*Sydenham's Chorea*, *St. Vitu's Dance*): involuntary grimacing and inability to use skeletal muscles in a coordinated manner (involvement of the CNS)
- **Subcutaneous Nodules**: marble-sized nodules around the joints.
- **Erythema Marginatum**: quickly-disappearing red spotty rashes that leave irregular circles on the skin.
## Minor Symptoms
- Reliable **history** of RF or evidence of pre-existing RHF.
- **Arthralgia** without inflammation, pain, or limited movement
- **Fever**: 38.9 - 40C
- Increased **ESR**, **ASO Filter** and **CRP**
- **ECG**: Prolonged PR Interval
___
# Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis of Rheumatic Carditis is done with the Jone's Criteria: assessment of 2 Major, or 1 Major + 2 Minor Symptoms + Supporting evidence of recent streptococcal infection
___
# Intervention
**The best intervention is prevention**; prevention of early identification of a streptococcal infection and prophylaxis with proper antibiotics. **The nurse should be familiar with the S/S of streptococcal pharyngitis**.
## Streptococcal Pharyngitis
- Fever (38.9 - 40C)
- Chills
- Sore Throat
- Diffuse redness of throat with exudates on the oropharynx.
- Enlarged/tender lymph nodes (Cervical Lymphadenopathy)
- Abdominal Pain
- Acute Sinusitis and Acute Otitis Media
## Management
- **Antibiotics**, the drug of choice of which is penicillin.
- **Aspirin** as an anticoagulant
- **Steroids** as an antiinflammatory
- **Antipyretics** and **Hydration** for fevers
- **Antibiotic Prophylaxis** with a monthly injection of penicillin
- **Bed Rest** with diversionary low-effort activities
- **Assess** for progression or improvement of **heart involvement**
