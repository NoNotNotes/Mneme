**Inflammation of the pericardium**, the thin outer covering of the heart.
- Associated with malignant neoplasms, idiopathic causes, infective organisms, as a post-MI syndrome (Dressler's Syndrome), postpericardiotomy syndrome, systemic connective tissue disease, and chronic renal failure (due to metabolites), chest trauma
- "Short-course" Pericarditis: <6 months; longer is considered Chronic Pericarditis.
- Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis leads to thickening of the pericardium by fibrous tissue formation, which leads to rigidity and subsequently inadequate ventricular filling, which results in heart failure.

# Assessment
1. **Pain** radiating to the neck, shoulder and back aggravated by inspiration, coughing and swallowing, and is worst when supine (inversely, relieved by sitting up or leaning forward)
2. **Pericardial Friction Rub**: a scratchy, high-pitched sound produced by the visceral and parietal pericardium rubbing together.
3. **Signs of RSHF** when pericardial rigidity develops.
4. **Thickening of the Pericardium** as revealed by CXR or ECHO.
5. **Increased WBC** count
6. **Atrial Fibrillation** is also common
___
# Intervention
- **NSAID**s (inhibition of prostaglandin, which causes pain) for pain management
- **Corticosteroids** if caused by an autoimmune disease.
- **Antibiotics** if caused by m.o.
- **Pericardial Drainage** (Pericardiocentesis, Pericardiostomy), the removed fluid may also be used for cultures and other studies.
- **Radiation** or **Chemotherapy** if caused by malignancy.
- **Hemodialysis** if caused by uremic pericarditis secondary to renal failure.
- Positioning for comfort.
- **Pericardiectomy** for those with chronic constrictive pericarditis.
- Monitor for **Pericardial Effusion** (>50mL)
___
# Pericardial Effusion
The accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity, which may eventually result in **cardiac tamponade**.
## Manifestations
- **Jugular Distention**: increased CVP
- **Pulsus Paradoxus**: hypotension with a further decrease of BP during inspiration.
- **Distant/Muffled Heart Sounds**
- **Circulatory Collapse** as a result of decreased cardiac output.
- **Altered Perfusion** (brain: lethargy, stuporous; systematic: cool, clammy skin; kidneys: oliguria)
## Intervention
- Emergency Care: **Pericardiocentesis**
- **Nursing Responsibilities**:
	- Preparation of items such as PPE, skin prep., sterile field, etc.
	- The patient is positioned in a semi/high-fowlers to allow gravity to help drain pericardial effusion.
