1. **Military Triage**: the oldest method of triage.

| Category   | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Emergent   | Patients who require medical attention **immediately**. |
| Urgent     | Patients who are able to wait for **12 to 24 hours**.   |
| Non-urgent | Patients who are able to wait for **days or weeks**.    |

2. **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Triage**

| Category      | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal**   | Minor injuries.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Delayed**   | Serious but not life-threatening.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Immediate** | Life-threatening.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Expectant** | Less likely to survive. This includes patients with cardiac arrest and respiratory arrest in cases of disaster due to the requisite efforts to perform resuscitation. |

3. **Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment** (START) **Protocol**:
	1. Start with the victim nearest to you upon entering the scene.
	2. Determine the victim's ability to walk. If they are able to, tag them as **green** and assist them to the treatment.
	3. Otherwise, determine if the victim is **breathing**. If the victim is not breathing, **reposition the patient and open the airway** (via jaw thrust).
		- If they continue to fail to breathe, tag them as **black**.
		- If they resume breathing, tag them as **red**.
	4. If the victim is breathing, **assess the respiratory rate**. The normal emergency respiratory rate is **12 to 30** RPM. Beyond this, the patient is tagged as **red**.
	5. If respirations are normal, proceed to assessing **circulation**. This is done by (a) checking the pulse, and more importantly, (b) **capillary refill time** that should be 2 seconds or shorter. If abnormal, tag the victim **red**.
	6. If circulation is normal, **assess the level of consciousness**. If they are disoriented or confused, tag the victim as **red**.
	7. If the level of consciousness is normal, tag the victim as **yellow**.

| **Green**; **Walking Wounded** | Victims that are able to walk on their own.                                                                                             |
| **Yellow**                     | Coherent but unable to walk.                                                                                                            |
| **Red**                        | Patients whose breathing is dependent on position or airway assistance, abnormal respiratory rate, abnormal perfusion, or abnormal LOC. |
| **Expectant**                  | Respiratory or cardiac arrest                                                                                                           |

4. **Emergency Severity Index** (ESI): a method of triage done in the emergency room when many victims arrive from a disaster. It also employs an algorithm:
	1. Assess the patient immediately if they are **in need of life-saving interventions**. If they require such interventions, they are classified as **ESI Level 1**.
	2. Otherwise, assess the patient if any of the following are present: (a) **high clinical symptoms** such as difficulty of breathing, (b) **altered level of consciousness**, and (c) **in severe distress**.
	3. If none of these are present, assess the patient for **the number of resources required by the patient**. These include the requirement of IV lines, catheters, bandages, etc.
		- If the patient requires multiple resources, **assess for danger zone vitals**: PR >100 BPM, RR >20 BPM, or an Oxygen Saturation of <92%. If these are present, **Categorize the patient as ESI Level 2**.
		- If the patient requires multiple resources but no danger zone vitals were present, **categorize the patient as ESI Level 3**.
		- If the patient requires only one resource for treatment, **categorize the patient as ESI Level 4**.
		- If the patient requires no resources for treatment, **categorize the patient as ESI Level 5**.

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ESI Level 1** | Patients who require life-saving interventions.                                                                          |
| **ESI Level 2** | Patients who exhibit any of (a) high clinical symptoms, (b) altered LOC, (c) severe distress, or (d) danger zone vitals. |
| **ESI Level 3** | Patients who require many resources for management but does not have any danger zone vitals.                             |
| **ESI Level 4** | Patients who only require one resource for treatment.                                                                    |
| **ESI Level 5** | Patients who do not require any resources for treatment.                                                                 |

5. **Reverse Triage**: an inversion; prioritization of **identifying the minimal cases** rather than the immediate/emergent ones. This is done to *efficiently remove cases that do not require emergent care* to free up hospital bed space, and to leave behind the cases that are life-threatening.
