1. **Menstrual Phase** or the **Bleeding Phase**, also known as menstruation. Day 1 to 4, lasting for 3 to 5 or 4 to 6 days. It is the **terminal phase** of the cycle.
	- Characterized by **vaginal bleeding** as the uterine endometrium is shed down to the basal layer along with blood from the capillaries and with the unfertilized ovum.
	- **Periodic discharge of blood, mucus, and cellular debris** from the uterine mucosa and occurs at regular, cyclic, and predictable intervals from menarche to menopause.
	- **The period of absolute infertility**
	- **Menarche** is the first onset of menstruation, occurring between 12 to 13 years of age; usually anovulatory, infertile, and irregular.
	- **25 to 60 mL of blood, with about 0.4 to 1.0 mg of iron** is lost every day.
	- Menstrual blood is incoagulable due to fibrinolytic activity.
2. **Follicular/Proliferative Phase**: Day 5 to 14, ending in ovulation; lasts about 9 days.
	- This phase is **controlled by estrogen**, where **the endometrium thickens by 8 to 10 times** during the first few days, known as the **regenerative phase**.
	- After changes level off at ovulation, the endometrium consists of three layers:
		- **Basal Layer**: 1 mm, thick, never alters
		- **Functional Layer**: 2.5 mm, contains tubular glands, consistently changes according to hormonal influences of the ovary
		- **Cuboidal Ciliated Epithelium Layer**: uppermost layer, covers the functional layer, and dips down to line the tubular glands
	- **Ovulation** is present in the middle of the cycle; monthly growth and release of a mature, non-fertilized ovum from the ovary. It is the **period of absolute fertility**. This usually occurs 13 to 15 (average of 14) days prior to the next cycle. At this point, estrogen is high while progesterone is low.
		- **Signs of ovulation** include breast tenderness, slight rise in BBT (0.3°C to 0.5°C; 0.4°F to 0.8°F) preceded by a slight drop (0.2°F) 24 to 36 hours before, related to changes in progesterone levels.
		- **The most fertile time** is 3 to 4 days before and 1 to 2 days after ovulation.
		- **Positive Spinnbarkeit/Creighton/Billings/Cervical Mucus Test**
		- **Mittelschmerz**, left or right lower quadrant pain corresponding to the rupturing of the Graafian follicle.
		- **Positive Ferning Test**
	- **Estimating ovulation time**: subtract 14 days from the menstrual cycle length e.g. it occurs on the 14th day in a 28-day cycle, and on the 16th day in a 30-day cycle.
		- **The period of fertility is calculated as five days before and two days after the day of ovulation**. In a 28-day cycle, the period of fertility is from 9 to 17th day counting from the first day of bleeding.
3. **Luteal/Secretory Phase**: Day 15 to 28; lasts about 12 days.
	- This phase is initiated by ovulation in response to a surge in LH that promotes the development of **corpus luteum** from the ruptured follicle, the *yellow* body that **secretes high levels of progesterone and estrogen**.
	- **Progesterone stimulates the already-proliferated endometrium**, causing the **functional layer** to become thicker (2.5 mm → 3.5 mm), more spongy, and softer with glands becoming more tortuous as the endometrial capillaries get distended with blood in preparation for **reception/implantation and nourishment** of the fertilized ovum.
		- **If fertilization occurs**, implantation follows 6 to 9 or 7 to 10 days (average 7 days) after. The corpus luteum **lives longer and secretes progesterone and estrogen in early pregnancy**, which is **later replaced by the placenta**. The normal lifespan for the corpus luteum is 10 to 14 days.
		- **If fertilization does not occur**, the corpus luteum *involutes* after 7 to 8 days after ovulation, becoming white (*corpus albicans*) which persists up to 10 to 12 days after ovulation. This causes a **drop in estrogen and progesterone, leading to the endometrial ischemic/premenstrual phase**.
