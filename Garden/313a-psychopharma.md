# Antipsychotics
Also termed as "**Neuroleptics**", these drugs **block dopamine receptors in the post-synaptic membrane and reduces dopaminergic activity**. There are two general types: **typical** (first generation; "conventional") and **atypical** (second generation) antipsychotics. There is also a new generation termed as **Dopamine System Stabilizers**.
- For **Schizophrenia**, **Bipolar Disorder**, **Autism**, **Psychosis**, **Tourette's Syndrome**, and **Severe Aggression**.
## Typical Antipsychotics
Used to treat **positive** symptoms of psychosis, serving as a **potent D<sub><strong>2</strong></sub> blocker**: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and behavior. Incidence of **EPSs** are **high**, also with high rates of **Tardive Dyskinesia**.
1. **Phenothiazines**
	- **Thorazine** (Chlorpromazine)
	- **Trilafon** (Perphenazine)
	- **Prolixin** (Fluphenazine)
	- **Mellaril** (Thioridazine)
	- **Serentil** (Mesoridazine)
	- **Stelazine** (Trifluphenazine)
2. **Thioxantene**
	- **Navane** (Thiothixine)
3. **Butyrophenones**
	- **Haldol** (Haloperidol)
	- **Inapsine** (Droperidol)
4. **Dibenzazepine**
	- **Loxitane** (Loxapine)
5. **Dihydroindolne**
	- **Moban** (Molindone)
## Atypical Antipsychotics
Treats both **positive** and **negative** symptoms of psychosis, being both a **weak D<strong><sub>2</sub></strong> receptor** and a **serotonin inhibitor**: anhedonia, avolition, asociality, alogia, anergia, apathy, affective disturbances.
- **Clozaril** (Clozapine)
- **Risperdal** (Risperidone)
- **Seroquel** (Quetiapine)
- **Zyprexa** (Olanzapine)
- **Geodon** (Ziprasidone)
## Dopamine System Stabilizers
The latest generation of antipsychotic drugs that stabilize dopamine production, reducing the hyperdopaminergic activity associated with psychosis. It is also associated with reduced incidence of EPSs and TD.
- **Aripiprazole** (Abilify)
- **Palliperidone** (Invega)

|Potent D<sub>2</sub> receptor blocker|Weak D<sub>2</sub> receptor blocker|Weak D<sub>2</sub> receptor blocker|
|High incidence of EPS and TD|Low incidence of EPS and TD|Rare incidence of EPS and TD|

			- Notify physician, withhold further medication, **admit client to ICU**, administer IVF and anti-arrythmics, maintain body temperature.
