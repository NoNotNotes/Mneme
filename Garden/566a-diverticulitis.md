**Acute inflammation and infection of** diverticulum caused by trapped fecal material and bacteria. If multiple diverticula are **affected**, it is **diverticulosis**. It may be caused by a **low fiber diet**, **chronic constipation** (both increase pressure on the colon), and **obesity** (alterations in the intestinal microbiome).
___

___
# Diagnostic Examination

___
# Nursing Intervention
- **Liberal fluid intake** of 2,500 to 3,000 ml/day.
- **Avoid nuts and seeds** as these can be trapped in the diverticula.

- During episodes of **acute symptom manifestations**,
	- Employ **bed rest** and **NPO** followed by a **clear liquid diet** to let the GIT rest.
