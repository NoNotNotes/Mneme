| **Assessment**     | Check for clinical signs of fever and hypothermia, appropriate sites for assessment, and factors that may alter core body temperature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Planning**       | **Assign**: routine measurements may be delegated to APs or even family members or caregivers in nonhospital settings. The nurse bears the responsibility of educating delegates for the type of thermometer to use, site to use, how to record findings, and when to report abnormal temperatures to the nurse. The nurse interprets abnormal temperatures and determines appropriate responses.<br><br>**Equipment**: thermometer and its sheath or cover, water-soluble lubricant (if rectal), towel (if axillary), and tissues or wipes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Implementation** | Make sure all gathered equipment are functioning normally. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and apply appropriate infection prevention procedures. Gloves are used for rectal temperatures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Position the client appropriately (e.g., lateral or Sims' position for inserting a rectal thermometer.</li><li>Place the thermometer, with a protective sheath or probe cover if appropriate. If rectal, lubrication is required.</li><li>Wait the appropriate amount of time. A light or tone appears in electronic or digital thermometers, while some disposable methods such as chemical dots or tape thermometers should be used based on package instructions.</li><li>Remove the thermometer and discard the cover or wipe with a tissue if necessary. Gloves are also removed and discarded if used.</li><li>Read the temperature and record it on your worksheet. If deviations are present, recheck with a thermometer known to be functioning properly.</li><li>Wash the thermometer if necessary and return it to its storage location.</li><li>Document the temperature in the client record. Follow protocol for specifying the site used for temperature assessment.</li></ol> |
| **Evaluation**     | Compare the temperature measurement to baseline data, normal range for age of client, and client's previous temperatures. Time of day and any additional influencing factors and other vital signs should be analyzed with the body temperature. Appropriate follow-up such as notifying the primary care provider if a temperature is outside of a specific range or is not responding to interventions, giving a medication, or altering the client's environment. This includes teaching the client how to lower an elevated temperature through actions such as increasing fluid intake, coughing and deep breathing, cool compresses, or removing heavy coverings. Interventions for hypothermia include intake of warm fluids and use of warm or electric blankets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

# Pulse
## Assessing a Peripheral Pulse
Peripheral pulses are obtained for purposes such as:
- To establish baseline data for subsequent evaluation.
- To identify whether the pulse rate is within the normal range.
- To determine the pulse volume and whether the pulse rhythm is regular.
- To determine the equality of corresponding peripheral pulses on each side of the body.
- To monitor and assess changes in the client's health status.
- To monitor clients at risk for pulse alterations.
- To evaluate blood perfusion to the extremities.

| **Planning**       | **Assign**: radial or brachial pulse assessment may be assigned to APs or family members or caregivers in nonhospital settings. The nurse bears responsibility for abnormal pulses (rate or rhythm), appropriate action after confirmation, and use of techniques for sites other than radial or brachial artery and Doppler ultrasound devices.<br><br>**Equipment**: clock, timer, or watch with a sweep second hand or digital seconds indicator.

| **Implementation** | Make sure all gathered equipment are functioning normally. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and observe appropriate infection prevention procedures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Select the pulse point. The radial pulse is the most commonly used site.</li><li>Assist the client to a comfortable resting position. The arm can stay rested on the chest for supine patients or on the lap for seated patients, with the palm facing down or inward.</li><li>Begin palpation. Two or three middle fingertips are placed lightly and squarely over the pulse point. The thumb is not used, as it has its own pulse that may be mistaken for the client's pulse.<ul><li>In stable patients, assessment may be measured for 15 seconds then multiplied by four. The initial assessment and any irregularities or abnormalities warrant assessment for a full minute.</li></ul></li><li>Assess the rhythm and volume. Note the pattern of the intervals between the beats. The pulse should be felt with moderate pressure, and maintains a stable pressure with each pulse. Record these findings.</li><li>Document pulse rate, rhythm, and volume and nursing actions in the client record. Pertinent data such as variations in pulse rate compared to normal for the client and abnormal skin color and skin temperature should be recorded in the nurse's notes.</li></ol>With the use of a **doppler ultrasound**, the stethoscope is plugged into the unit and the transmission gel is applied to the probe or on the skin. This ensures an air-tight seal that improves the clarity of ultrasound reception by the device. The device is turned on and held against the skin on the pulse site with light pressure, keeping the probe in contact with the skin. Too much pressure will obliterate the signal and halt blood flow. The volume is adjusted as necessary and sounds are interpreted— differentiate arterial (pulsating; pumping) from venous (intermittent, varies with respirations) sounds. These can be heard simultaneously through the DUS. If arterial sounds are difficult to hear, reposition the probe. If no sounds are heard, reposition to several locations of the same area before determining that no pulse is present. Afterwards, clean the gel on the transducer with a tissue or wipe, then with a water-based solution. Alcohol or other disinfectants may damage the face of the transducer. |
| **Evaluation**     | Compare the pulse rate, rhythm, and volume to recent, baseline, or usual range for the age of the client and other vital signs or health status. In assessing peripheral pulses, equality, rate, and volume are all assessed in corresponding extremities. Appropriate follow-up is conducted for notifying the primary care provider of any abnormalities or after the administration of medication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
## Assessing an Apical Pulse
The apical pulse is obtained for purposes such as:
- To obtain the heart rate of an adult with an irregular peripheral pulse.
- To establish baseline data for subsequent evaluation.
- To determine normalcy and regularity of the cardiac rate.
- To monitor clients with cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease and those receiving medications to improve heart action.

| **Implementation** | Make sure all gathered equipment are functioning normally. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and observe appropriate infection prevention procedures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Assist the client to a comfortable supine or sitting position. The area of the chest over the apex of the heart is exposed.</li><li>Locate the apical pulse; the area where the apical pulse can be most clearly heard.<ul><li>Palpate the angle of Louis, then slide the index finger just to the left of the sternum, and palpate the second intercostal space. Continue palpating downward until you locate the fifth intercostal space.</li><li>At the fifth intercostal space, move the index finger laterally towards the MCL. The apical impulse is palpable at or just medial to the MCL.</li></ul></li><li>Auscultate and count heartbeats. Clean the stethoscope with the antiseptic wipes, warm the diaphragm by holding it in the palm of the hand for a moment, and check for proper functioning of the stethoscope with light taps on the diaphragm.</li><li>Place the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the apical impulse and listen for the normal S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> heart sounds ("lub-dub").</li><li>If the apical pulse is difficult to auscultate, the supine patient may be asked to roll onto their left side or the seated patient to lean forward. These positions move the apex of the heart closer to the chest wall.<ul><li>A 30-second assessment can be used for a patient with regular rhythm. If the rhythm is irregular or medications are being given, a full 60-second assessment is performed.</li></ul></li><li>Assess the rhythm and strength of the heartbeat by noting the interval between the beats and volume. Equal intervals, and consistent volume is a normal pulse.</li><li>Document pulse rate, rhythm, and volume and nursing actions in the client record. Pertinent data such as variations in pulse rate compared to normal for the client and abnormal skin color and skin temperature should be recorded in the nurse's notes.</li></ol><br> |
| **Evaluation**     | Compare the pulse rate, rhythm, and volume to recent, baseline, or usual range for the age of the client and other vital signs or health status. Report to the primary care provider and other relevant members of the healthcare team any abnormal findings such as irregular rhythm, reduced ability to hear the heartbeat, pallor, cyanosis, dyspnea, tachycardia, or bradycardia.<br><br> Appropriate follow-up is conducted, such as administering medication ordered based on apical heart rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
## Assessing an Apical-Radial Pulse
In cases of suspected peripheral circulation inadequacy or a pulse deficit, an apical-radial pulse is obtained. This involves obtaining apical and radial rates simultaneously to determine abnormalities such as a pulse too weak to be felt at the peripheral pulses, or the presence of vascular disease that prevents impulses from being transmitted. A discrepancy in apical pulse rate and peripheral pulse rate is called a **pulse deficit** and must be reported immediately. This technique can be performed by one or two nurses.

| **Implementation** | If using the two-nurse technique, ensure that the second nurse is available. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and observe appropriate infection prevention procedures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Assist the client to a comfortable supine or sitting position. The area of the chest over the apex of the heart is exposed. If this is following a previous assessment, the previous position is not changed.</li><li>Locate the apical and radial pulse sites; auscultation is used for the apical pulse and palpation is used for the radial pulse.</li><li>Count and characterize the apical and radial pulse rates.<ul><li>**Two-nurse Technique**: each nurse begins counting according to the timing of one nurse or by a clock on the room.</li><li>**One-nurse Technique**: feel the radial pulse at the same time as listening to the apical pulse. Assess if they are not synchronized. If an abnormality is detected, a 60-second assessment of the apical pulse then immediately after a 60-second assessment of the radial pulse is performed.</li></ul></li><li>Document pulse rate, rhythm, and volume and nursing actions in the client record. Pertinent data such as variations in pulse rate compared to normal for the client and abnormal skin color and skin temperature should be recorded in the nurse's notes.</li></ol><br> |
| **Evaluation**     | Compare the pulse rate, rhythm, and volume to recent, baseline, or usual range for the age of the client and other vital signs or health status. Report any changes from previous measurements or any discrepancy between the two pulse rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# Respirations
Assessing respirations is done to:
- Establish baseline data for subsequent evaluation.
- Identify whether the respirations are within the normal range
- Monitor respirations before or after the administration of a general anesthetic or medication that influences respirations.
- Monitor clients at risk for respiratory alterations (fever, pain, acute anxiety, etc.).

| **Assessment**     | Assess skin and mucous membrane color (e.g., cyanosis, pallor), position assumed for breathing (e.g., use of orthopneic position), signs of lack of oxygen to the brain (e.g., irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, or loss of consciousness), chest movements (e.g., retractions between the ribs or above or below the sternum), activity tolerance, chest pain, dyspnea, medications affecting respiratory rate, and history of pulmonary conditions, smoking, exposure to toxic fumes, and living with others who smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Planning**       | **Assign**: counting and observing respirations may be assigned to APs. The nurse bears the responsibility of follow-up assessments, interprets abnormal respirations, and determines appropriate interventions.<br><br>**Equipment**: clock, timer, or watch with a sweep second hand or digital seconds indicator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Implementation** | For a routine assessment of respirations, determine the client's activity schedule and choose a suitable time to monitor the respirations. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and observe appropriate infection prevention procedures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Observe or palpate and count the respiratory rate. The knowledge of the client about their respirations being observed can alter findings. A method to mitigate this effect is to place the client's arm across the chest while supposedly taking the radial pulse.<ul><li>Stable patients may be observed for 30 seconds rather than the full 60 seconds; any irregularities will warrant a 60-second assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Observe the depth, rhythm, and character of respirations. Depth is based on the amount of movement of the chest. Intervals and timing is used to determine rhythm. Character is based on sound and effort.</li><li>Document the respiratory rate, depth, rhythm, and character on the appropriate record.</li></ol><br> |
| **Evaluation**     | Compare the respiratory rate, rhythm, and depth to recent, baseline, or usual range for the age of the client and other vital signs or health status. Appropriate follow-up is conducted for notifying the primary care provider of any abnormalities or expression of dyspnea. Collaboration with other healthcare team members, such as the respiratory therapist, is arranged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

# Blood Pressure
Assessing respirations is done to:
- Establish baseline measurement of arterial blood pressure for subsequent evaluation.
- Determine the client's hemodynamic status (e.g., cardiac output: stroke volume of the heart and blood vessel resistance)
- Identify and monitor changes in blood pressure resulting from a disease process or medical therapy

| **Implementation** | Ensure that the equipment is intact and functioning properly. Check for leaks in the tubing between the cuff and the sphygmomanometer. Calibrate as necessary. **Ensure that it has been at least 30 minutes since the last ingestion of caffeine or smoking**. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and observe appropriate infection prevention procedures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Position the client appropriately.<ul><li>The adult client should be sitting unless otherwise specified. Both feet should be flat on the floor. Crossed legs will elevate readings.</li><li>The elbow should be slightly flexed with the palm of the hand facing up and the arm supported <strong>at heart level</strong>. Variations from this position should be noted upon documentation if performed.</li><li>Expose the upper arm.</li></ul></li><li>Wrap the deflated cuff evenly around the upper arm. Locate the brachial artery, and apply the center of the bladder directly over the artery. In an adult, this is approximately <strong>2.5 cm (1 in.) above the antecubital space</strong>.</li><li>If this is the initial examination, perform a preliminary palpatory determination of systolic pressure, which will be used as basis for estimated systolic pressure. Palpate the brachial artery and pump up the cuff until it is no longer felt. Note this pressure.</li><li>Position the stethoscope appropriately. Make sure the stethoscope is clean and the earpieces are worn correctly (tilted slightly forward).The <strong>bell-shaped diaphragm</strong> is used because blood pressure sounds are low-frequency, but the American Heart Association states both the bell and diaphragm can be used. The amplifier is placed on the skin, not over cloth.</li><li>Auscultate the client's blood pressure.<ul><li>Pump up the cuff until the sphygmomanometer reads 30 mmHg above the point the brachial pulse disappeared, then release the valve carefully so that the pressure decreases at a rate of 20 to 30 mm Hg per second. As the manometer falls, take note of the pressure at the time Korotkoff sounds 1, 4, and 5 are heard. Sounds 2 and 3 are not clinically significant. Once phase 5 is heard, the cuff is deflated rapidly and completely.</li><li>After 1 to 2 minutes, repeat the above steps to confirm the accuracy of the reading. If significant difference (>5 mmHg) is observed, further measurements may be required and averaged.</li></ul></li><li>If this is the client's initial assessment, it is repeated on the client's arm. A difference of 10 mmHg between the arms is common in hypertensive and diabetic clients, and should be evaluated further.</li><li>Remove the cuff, and wipe with an approved disinfectant. Uncleaned cuffs may become significantly contaminated. If the cuff is disposable, dispose according to institution policy.</li><li>Document and report pertinent assessment data according to agency policy. Record two pressures in the form "130/80" where "130" is the systolic (phase 1) and "80" is the diastolic (phase 5) pressure. Record three pressures in the form for phase 1, phase 4, and phase 5, "130/90/0", if sounds are audible even after complete deflation. Indicate the extremity used for assessment with RA or RL for right arm or right leg and LA or LL for left arm or left leg.</li></ol><br> |
| **Evaluation**     | Relate blood pressure to other vital signs, to baseline data, and to health status. If findings are significant different from previous values without obvious reasons, consider possible causes of error. Any significant changes are reported. Abnormal findings that persist over time are also reported:<br><ul><li>Systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg</li><li>Diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg</li><li>Systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg</li><li>Inter-arm differences of greater than 10 mmHg</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
## Variations
1. **Palpation Method**: if a stethoscope is not usable, palpate the radial or brachial pulse sites as the cuff pressure is released. The manometer reading at the point where the **pulse reappears** is an estimate of systolic value. The manometer reading at the point where the **whiplike vibration** appears is an estimate of the diastolic pressure.
2. **Thigh Blood Pressure**:
	- The patient is positioned **prone**. If contraindicated, the client is positioned **supine with the knee slightly flexed**.
	- Expose the thigh, taking care not to expose the client unduly.
	- Locate the popliteal artery.
	-  Wrap the cuff evenly around the midthigh with the compression bladder over the posterior aspect of the thigh and the bottom edge above the knee.
	- If this is the client's initial examination, perform a preliminary palpatory determination of systolic pressure by palpating the popliteal artery.
	- In adults, the systolic pressure in the popliteal artery is usually 20 to 30 mmHg higher than that in the brachial artery; the diastolic pressure is usually the same.
3. **Electronic Indirect Blood Pressure Monitoring Device**: an automated machine can be given a preset for wait periods, repeated assessments, and averaged assessments while the client is resting quietly, seated in a chair, and alone in the room. This can also be left in place for many hours. The cuff should be removed periodically to check skin condition.

# Oxygen Saturation

>[!WARNING] Specifications
>This procedure is based on the use of pulse oximeters with a separate sensor and a machine. It is common to rely entirely on pocket pulse oximeters that can provide a reading directly. A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27164204/) (2016) compared pocket vs standard pulse oximeters and found a minimal mean difference (0.01%).

Assessing respirations is done to:
- Estimate the arterial blood oxygen saturation
- Detect the presence of hypoxemia before visible signs develop

| **Implementation** | Check that the oximeter equipment is functioning normally. Prior to performing the procedure, the nurse must introduce themselves and verify the client's identity using agency protocol. Explanation of the nurse's purpose, the procedure, and how the patient will participate.<br><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene and observe appropriate infection prevention procedures.</li><li>Provide client privacy.</li><li>Choose a sensor appropriate for the client's size and desired location.<ul><li>If the client is allergic to adhesive, use a clip or sensor without adhesive.</li><li>For oximeters using extremities, ensure that perfusion is adequate.</li></ul></li><li>Prepare the site. It must be clean and dark nail polish must be removed to avoid inaccuracies.</li><li>Apply the sensor, and connect it to the pulse oximeter. These may beep, indicating the detecting of arterial pulsations.</li><li>Set and turn on the alarm when using continuous monitoring. Presets for high and low oxygen saturation and high and low pulse rates may be set according to agency policy. Audio and visual alarms are double-checked as enabled before leaving the client.</li><li>Ensure client safety. Adhesive sensors are inspected (for irritation) and switched sites every 4 hours, and sprint-tension (clip) sensors are inspected and switched sites every 2 hours.</li><li>Minimize sources of error:<ul><li>Minimize motion artifacts; use adhesive-type sensors, change sensor site, or immobilize the client if absolutely necessary.</li><li>Cover the sensor with a sheet or towel to block large amounts of light from external sources, which may interfere with readings.</li><li>Comparisons of the reported pulse rate and radial pulse should be done periodically.</li></ul></li><li>Document the oxygen saturation on the appropriate record at designated intervals.</li></ol> |
| **Evaluation**     | Compare the oxygen saturation to the client’s previous oxygen saturation level. Relate to pulse rate and other vital signs. Conduct appropriate follow-up such as notifying the primary care provider, adjusting oxygen therapy, or providing breathing treatments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
