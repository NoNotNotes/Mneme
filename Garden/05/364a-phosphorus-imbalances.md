description: Phosphorus is also used in the formation of bone and teeth, used in cell structure, and aids use of glucose. Its normal value is 3.0 to 4.5 mEq/L (0.97 to 1.45 mmol/L).

# Hypophosphatemia

>[!INFO] Normal Serum Phosphorus Level: 3.0 to 4.5 mg/dL (0.97 to 1.45 mmol/L)

>[!INFO] Phosphorus and calcium have a reciprocal relationship in the body; a decrease in phosphorus reflects an increase in calcium and vice versa.

Hypophosphatemia is a serum level of **less than 3.0 mg/dL** (0.97 mmol/L). It may be caused by:
1. **Insufficient phosphorus intake**: malnutrition and starvation
2. **Increased phosphorus excretion**: hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, and use of magnesium-based or aluminum hydroxide-based antacid
3. **Intracellular shift**: hyperglycemia, respiratory alkalosis
## Assessment
Because of the accompanying imbalance of **calcium** with phosphate imbalances, assessment data is reflective of the opposing imbalance i.e. hypophosphatemia presents with the clinical picture of hypercalcemia.

>[!WARNING] Hypophosphatemia may be asymptomatic until levels become very low.

## Interventions
- **Discontinue medications** that contribute to low phosphorus levels.
- Administer phosphorus **orally with a vitamin D supplement**. Prepare to administer phosphorus **intravenously** when serum phosphorus levels fall **below 1 mg/dL** and when the client experiences critical clinical manifestations. Phosphorus is administered slowly to prevent overcorrection.
- **Assess the renal system** before administering phosphorus.
- Move the client carefully and **monitor for signs of pathologic fracture**.
- **Increase the intake of phosphorus-containing foods**: seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, and squash), whey, cheese, cornmeal, beans, and salt-free nuts (almonds, peanuts).
	- **Decrease dietary calcium intake** (refer to hypercalcemia).

# Hyperphosphatemia
A serum phosphorus level over 4.5 mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L). Most body systems tolerate an elevated phosphorus level well; the **problems that arise are the result of the accompanying hypocalcemia** that is produced with hyperphosphatemia. Its causes include:
1. **Decreased renal excretion** resulting from renal insufficiency
2. **Tumor lysis syndrome**
3. **Increased intake of phosphorus**, including dietary intake and phosphate-containing laxatives or enemas
4. **Hypoparathyroidism**
## Assessment
Assessment is the same as for hypocalcemia for reasons stated above.
## Interventions
- Interventions entail the management of hypocalcemia.
- Administer **phosphate-binding medications** that increase fecal excretion of phosphorus by binding phosphorus from the food in the gastrointestinal tract.
- Instruct the client to **avoid phosphate-containing medications**, including laxatives and enemas.
- Instruct the client to **decrease** the intake of **food that is high in phosphorus**: seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, and squash), whey, cheese, cornmeal, beans, and salt-free nuts (almonds, peanuts).
- Instruct the client in medication administration: take **phosphate-binding medications**, emphasizing that they should be **taken with meals or immediately after meals**.
