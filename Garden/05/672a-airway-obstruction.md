Otherwise known as **choking**. This is most commonly caused by **food** in adults and **small toys** in children (Lego bricks, coins, marbles, etc.)
1. The universal sign of choking is a patient who is **clutching their neck**.
2. **Difficulty of breathing**
3. **Sound production** will vary depending on the degree of blockage of the airway. In patients whose airways are only **partially blocked**, they may still produce noises or talk. If there is **full blockage**, the patient will produce no sound.
4. **Restlessness**
5. **Stridor**, a harsh, rough sound that appears during inhalation.
6. **Color changes**: initially **pallor**, then **redness** from pressure, then **cyanosis**.
7. **Decreasing LOC** as choking becomes prolonged.

First aid is not immediately applied. Most cases (80%) of FBAO resolves independently; **first, ask the patient if they require help**. If help is required:
1. **Ask the patient to cough forcefully**.
2. If the patient is unable to cough the obstruction out, perform the **heimlich maneuver**.
3. If the patient is unconscious, the heimlich maneuver may be performed while **side-lying**.
4. If the patient is unconscious, the **abdominal/chest thrust** may be used.
5. Once the foreign body has been dislodged (evidenced by the sound of air escaping the body in a pop-ish sound), **assess for the foreign body and remove it with the finger sweep technique**.
6. Once recovering, the patient is placed on the **recovery position** (side-lying), and the patient is **transported to the hospital**.

___

# In The Emergency Room
If the obstruction has not been removed and the patient has been brought to the emergency room, a **tracheostomy is immediately performed**, followed by **oxygenation**.
1. Once an airway and oxygen has been established, the patient is scheduled for **endoscopic extraction** of the foreign body.
