**MG** is an autoimmune disorder affecting the **myoneural junction**, characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the voluntary muscles.
- It is more common in women during the second and third decades of life, but becomes more common in men after the fifth decade of life.
- 85% of MG cases feature antibodies. Most cases have either **thymic hyperplasia** or a **thymic tumor**, with the **thymus gland is believed to be the site of antibody production**. In the 15% of cases without acetylcholine receptor antibodies, other antibodies appear to target a protein in the myoneural junction.

# Clinical Manifestations
**Descending paralysis**. Manifestations are variable. MG is purely a **motor** disorder with no effect on sensation or coordination. There are two clinical types:
1. **Ocular**: only the eye muscles are involved, featuring **ptosis** (characteristic) and **diplopia**.
2. **Generalized**: the **face** (facial weakness; bland facial expression), **throat** (dysphagia, dysphonia), **limbs** (generalized weakness), and **respiratory muscles** (decreased vital capacity and respiratory failure; **myasthenic crisis**) are affected.

A complication of these manifestations is a **myasthenic crisis**:
- **Severe generalized muscle weakness** and respiratory or bulbar weakness that may result in **respiratory failure**. The earliest presenting sign of respiratory failure is observed in falling vital capacities and respiratory function tests.
- **Cholinesterase inhibitors** are stopped during respiratory failure, and gradually restarted once improvement is demonstrated after plasmapheresis or IVIG.
- **Sedative and tranquilizing agents are avoided** as they aggravate hypoxia and hypercapnia. These agents can cause respiratory and cardiac depression.

Mnemonic:
1. **6 Ds**: Debility (fatigue), Drooping (Ptosis), Dysarthria, Dysphagia, Diplopia, and Dyspnea

___

# Diagnostic Examination
**Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Test** (Tensilon Test): the administration of **edrophonium chloride IV** should **resolve facial weakness and ptosis** for about **5 minutes** after 30 seconds. Immediate improvement represents a positive test, often confirming the diagnosis.
- **Atropine** (an anticholinergic) should be available to counteract side effects of bradycardia, asystole, bronchoconstriction, sweating, and cramping.
- In patients who have asthma and cardiac problems that may not be able to tolerate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the **ice test** may be used—place an ice pack over the eyes for 1 minute, after which **ptosis should resolve temporarily** if MG is present.

___

# Management
1. **Medical**: focuses on (a) **improving functioning** and (b) **reducing or removing circulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies**. There is no cure for MG. Production of acetylcholine receptor antibodies does not stop.
	- **Therapeutic Plasma Exchange** (prev. *plasmapheresis*) is used to treat exacerbations. The patient's plasma and its components are removed through a centrally placed large-bore double-lumen catheter. The blood and plasma are separated, with the blood being combined with replacement plasma and being reinfused. Patient response determines number of treatments. These are done on a daily or alternate-day basis.
2. **Pharmacologic**:
	- **Pyridostigmine bromide**, an **anticholinesterase** medication, is the first line of therapy.
	- **Immunomodulating** (immunosuppressant) **drugs** aim to reduce the production of antibodies: **corticosteroids** (Prednisone), **cytotoxic medications** are used if steroids are ineffective—**azathioprine** inhibits T lymphocytes and B cell proliferation and reduces acetylcholine receptor antibody levels.
	- **IVIG** for exacerbations
3. **Surgical**: A **Total Thymectomy** can produce antigen-specific immunosuppression and result in clinical improvement.

# Nursing Care Management
MG is a chronic disease, and therefore most patients are treated on an outpatient basis. Most nursing care involves patient and family education. Educational topics for outpatient self-care include:
1. **Medication management**: actions of medications, schedule, and consequences of delaying medication.
2. **Energy conservation**—optimal **rest periods** throughout the day, keeping necessities on one floor of the living quarters, handicapped license plates to minimize walking distance, schedule activities during peak energy levels in the day. Use consistent routines, scheduling rest periods, and monitor for depression. Maintain a good sleep pattern.
3. To prevent corneal damage when eyes do not completely close, the patient is instructed to **tape the eyes shut for short periods** and to regularly instill artificial tears. Diplopia can be corrected by patching one eye or wearing prism glasses.
4. **Prevention and management of complications**:
	- Teach the patient and family about the signs and symptoms of **myasthenic and cholinergic crises**.
	- To minimize the risk for aspiration, mealtimes should be held during the **peak effects of anticholinesterase medication**. Rest before meals is encouraged. Sitting upright should be done during meals. Soft foods are easier to swallow. Large meals should be had in the morning and smaller ones at night. Suctioning should be available at home, with the family members trained for its use.
