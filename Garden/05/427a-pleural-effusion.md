description: A pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluids (clear, exudative, purulent, blood) in the pleural cavity.
---
A pleural effusion is a collection of fluid in the pleural space, usually secondary to other diseases (heart failure, tuberculosis, pneumonia, pulmonary infections, nephrotic syndrome, connective tissue disease, pulmonary embolism, and neoplastic tumors). Normally, the pleural space contains a small amount of fluid (5 to 15 mL), which acts as a lubricant that allows the pleural spaces to move without friction.

>[!ERROR] Pathophysiology
>In certain disorders, fluids may accumulate in the pleural space to a point at which it becomes clinically evident. This almost always has a pathologic significance.
>1. The effusion can be (a) a **relatively clear fluid**â€”**transudate** (filtrate of plasma that moves across intact capillary walls) or (b) an **exudate** (extravasation of fluid into tissues or a cavity).
>	- Transudates may be due to pathologies in the formation and reabsorption of pleural fluid, usually by an imbalance in hydrostatic or oncotic pressures. Transudative pleural effusions are most commonly due to heart failure.
>	- Exudates usually result from inflammation by bacterial products or tumors involving the pleural surfaces. The most common malignancy associated with a pleural effusion is a bronchogenic carcinoma.
>2. The effusion can also be **bloody** or **purulent**.

# Clinical Manifestations
The accompanying clinical manifestations of a pleural effusion is **often due to the etiologic cause of the effusion** rather than the effusion itself. For example, a pleural effusion caused by pneumonia will be accompanied by fever, chills, and pleuritic chest pain, whereas a malignant effusion may result in dyspnea, difficulty lying flat, and coughing.

**The severity of symptoms is determined by the size of the effusion**, the speed of its formation, and the underlying lung disease. A large pleural effusion causes dyspnea. A small-to-moderate pleural effusion causes minimal or no dyspnea.

# Assessment and Diagnostic Findings
Assessment of the area of the pleural effusion reveals **decreased or absent breath sounds**; **decreased fremitus**; and a **dull, flat sound on percussion**. These all occur because fluids don't transmit sound very well. In the case of an extremely large pleural effusion, the assessment reveals a patient in **acute respiratory distress**. A large effusion places pressure on the lungs, disallowing it from expanding and filling with air. **Tracheal deviation away from the affected side** may also be apparent, as the effusion physically pushes the lungs to the opposite side.
1. **Physical examination**,
2. Chest X-ray
3. Laboratory Tests

- **Clinical Manifestations**: depending on size. May be asymptomatic, may be acute respiratory distress. Dullness or flatness in percussion over the affected area, minimal or absent breath sounds, absent fremitus, and tracheal deviation may be observed.
- **Diagnostics**: physical examination (percussion, auscultation), CXR, CCT, Thoracentesis, Pleural biopsy and fluid analysis
- **Medical Management**: discover the underlying cause, prevent re-accumulation of fluid (thoracentesis, shunting, chemical pleurodesis, pleurectomy), relieve discomfort and pain.
- **Nursing Interventions**: prepare for thoracentesis, monitor drainage and water-seal system, pain relief (medications, positioning, ambulation), education for catheter/tube care for drainage if to be discharged.
