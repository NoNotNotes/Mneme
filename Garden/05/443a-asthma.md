Hyperresponsivity of the lungs in mucosal edema and production.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: coughing, wheezing, and dyspnea (triad); bronchospasm causes difficulty in exertion and may progress, leading to central cyanosis and hypoxia.
	- A continuous reaction is *status asthmaticus*, a potentially fatal state.
	- Accompanying allergic manifestations along with asthma: rashes, eczema, edema.
- **Diagnostics**: family, environmental, and occupational history; in acute episodes, sputum/blood tests, pulse oximetry, ABG (hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis) and pulmonary function tests
- **Medical Management**: mainly pharmacologic. Long-acting control and quick-relief medications are available: short-acting beta-adrenergic agents, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, methylxanthines.
- **Nursing Management**: assess respiratory status (breath sounds, flow rate, pulse oximetry, vital signs), assess family history of pharmacologic allergies, teach self-care.
