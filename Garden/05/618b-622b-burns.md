A burn is an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by thermal, radioactive, electrical, or chemical exposure. This poses many problems as destruction of tissue and cells results in impaired skin integrity, fluid imbalance, and electrolyte imbalance.
1. **Thermal Burns**: exposure to high temperatures, the most common form of burning. The most common cause is fire, which requires four elements to appear:
	- **Heat**: sufficient heat is required for a heat to sustain its chain reaction.
	- **Oxygen**: oxygen is essential for the chemical reaction of a fire. Oxygen is a flammable gas.
	- **Fuel**: fuel is continuously consumed in fire
	- **Chain Reaction**/**Combustion**
2. **Chemical Burns**: exposure to highly acidic or highly alkaline substances.
3. **Electrical Burns**: exposure to electricity, the most lethal form of burning.
4. **Radiation Burns**: exposure to UV or gamma radiation.

A burn can be classified according to the depth of tissue involved:
1. **First Degree Burn**: superficial to partial thickness burns that burn the epidermis, resulting in redness and mild to moderate pain. The most common type of first degree burn is a sunburn.
2. **Second Degree Burn**: deep partial thickness burns that penetrate deep into the dermis. This results in blistering, a “weeping” appearance of the injury, and severe pain. These are the types of burn to result from scalding and flash flames.
3. **Third Degree Burn**: full thickness burns that reach muscle or even bones. The skin appears pale-white or charred, and experiences no pain due to the destruction of nerves. These may be caused by extreme exposure to thermal burns or due to an electrical or chemical burn.

| Degree                     | Depth                                 | Manifestations                  | Pain Level         | Wound Healing                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| First Degree (Superficial) | **Epidermis**; Surface-level          | Desquamation (unique)           | Mild to moderate   | 5 to 7 days                   |
| Second Degree              | **Dermis**; Partial Thickness         | Blistering and weeping (unique) | Moderate to Severe | 3 to 4 weeks                  |
| Third Degree               | **Beyond the dermis**; Full Thickness | Charring                        | None               | None; permanent disfigurement |

# Stages of a Burn Injury
1. **Emergent Stage** (Fluid Accumulation Stage; first 24-48 hours): the shifting of fluid from the intravascular space to the interstitial spaces.
	- This is the cause of **hypovolemia**, tachycardia, and weak pulses.
	- Fluid also includes sodium, which means **hyponatremia** occurs.
	- In cellular injury, the intracellular potassium leaks out, which produces **hyperkalemia**.
2. **Acute Stage** (Fluid Remobilization Stage; **Diuretic Stage**; 3 to 4 days): the shifting of fluid back from the interstitial spaces to the intravascular space.
	- This presents a problem when the shifted fluid has been replaced, and its return will result in **hypervolemia**.
	- **Urine output will increase**, giving this stage its alternate name.
	- Diuresis also involves the excretion of potassium, which **results in hypokalemia**.
	- Sodium levels become **unstable**. Both hyper- and hyponatremia can occur.
3. **Recovery Stage** (5 days+): normalization of the patient's status.

# Management

>[!TIP] First Aid
>1. **Extinguish the fire**, if the patient is still actively on fire. Alternatively, "logrolling" the patient can be done to extinguish fire.
>2. If the patient has been extinguished, **open the airway**.
>3. **Cool water may be applied over the burns**, but not ice. No other substances must be used, even burn ointments.
>4. **Remove clothing over burns**.
>5. **Cover the wound with wet dressing** (wet to avoid adhesion).
>6. **Transport** the patient.

In the hospital, burn management is focused on (a) **infection prophylaxis**, (b) **fluid resuscitation**, and (c) **supportive therapy for electrolyte imbalances**. They vary along with what phase of the burn is being managed:
1. **Emergent (Hypovolemic) Phase**: the onset of injury, where capillaries are leaking and intravascular fluid shifts from intravascular to interstitial spaces. These both result in **hemoconcentration**, and **hyponatremia**. **Hyperkalemia** is also produced by the expulsion of intracellular potassium content from destroyed cells.
	- **Airway patency** must be secured due to potential damage from smoke inhalation and thermal burns of the airway.
	- **Fluid resuscitation with Lactated Ringer’s Solution** is a major component of management. LRS is used to stimulate the body with lactic acid (i.e., lactate) in order to stimulate the body to produce bicarbonate for correction of metabolic acidosis. The amount of fluid to be given is based on Parkland’s Formula and the Rule of Nines (discussed later).
	- **Administer narcotic analgesics for pain**. The drug of choice is **Morphine sulfate**.
	- **Administer tetanus prophylaxis**.
	- **NGT Insertion** may be done to remove gastric acids to avoid the occurrence of **Curling's ulcer**.
2. **Intermediate (Hypervolemic) Phase**: the interstitial fluids begin to return to intravascular spaces which have been refilled with fluid resuscitation in the first phase. This results in **hypervolemia** and a **diuretic** phase. Electrolyte imbalances reverse—**hypernatremia** and **hypokalemia** (excreted along with the urine).
	- **Prevention and treatment of infection** becomes a larger focus of therapy. The drug of choice for infection prophylaxis is **Mafenide Acetate** (**Sulfamylon**), a topical antibiotic.
3. **Rehabilitation Phase**: complications such as contractures and scarring are minimized. **Cosmetic reconstruction** (e.g., skin grafting) is considered.
	- Skin may be (a) an **autograft**, where skin is sourced from one’s own body; (b) an **allograft**, where skin is sourced from human cadavers; or (c) a **xenograft**, where skin is sourced from non-human species.

# Burn Formulas
**Total Body Surface Area** is calculated with the Rule of Nines. **The Rule of Nines** is a quick-assessment method to determine the percentage of the total body surface area percentage (TBSA%) of a burn. Be critical in determining percentages: presentations may involve only the anterior portion of a body part—this would halve the body part's respective percentage. For example, the “*anterior chest*” would be ~9% as the anterior trunk is divided between the chest and the abdomen; “*a circumferential burn of the left upper arm*” would be approximately 4.5%, as it involves both the front and back of the upper arm.

| Part of the Body      |  Adult   |  Infant  |
| --------------------- | :------: | :------: |
| **Head**              |    9%    |   18%    |
| **Anterior Trunk**    |   18%    |   18%    |
| **Posterior Trunk**   |   18%    |   18%    |
| **Upper Extremities** | 9% each  | 9% each  |
| **Lower Extremities** | 18% each | 14% each |
| **Genital**           |    1%    |    0%    |

TBSA% is used in **Parkland’s Formula**, a formula used to estimate the required volume of fluids (crystalloid fluids, most commonly Lactated Ringer’s Solution) to be infused within the first 24 hours of therapy.

$$LR = 4\text{ mL}\times\text{TBSA\%}\times\text{Weight (kg)}$$

The final volume to be given is divided into three segments in the first 24 hours of 8 hours each.
1. **First 8 hours**: 50% of the total volume to be given. Divide the **total** value by two.
2. Next 8 hours: 25% of the total volume to be given. Divide the **total** value by four.
3. Next 8 hours: 25% of the total volume to be given.
