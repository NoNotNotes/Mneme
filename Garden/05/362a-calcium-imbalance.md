# Hypocalcemia

>[!INFO] Normal Serum Calcium Level: 9 to 10.5 mg/dL (2.25 to 2.75 mmol/L)

**Hypocalcemia** is a serum calcium level lower than **9.0 mg/dL** (2.25 mmol/L). Its causes include:
1. **Inhibition of calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract**: inadequate calcium intake, lactose intolerance (lactose enhances calcium absorption<sup>[citation needed]</sup>), malabsorption syndromes e.g. celiac sprue or Crohn's disease, inadequate vitamin D intake, and end-stage kidney disease.
2. **Increased calcium excretion**: kidney disease (polyuric phase), diarrhea, steatorrhea, and wound drainage (especially gastrointestinal).
3. **Conditions that decrease the ionized fraction of calcium**: hyperproteinemia, alkalosis, medications (calcium chelators or binders), acute pancreatitis, hyperphosphatemia, and removal or destruction of the parathyroid glands.
## Assessment
1. **Cardiovascular**:
	- Decreased heart rate
	- Hypotension
	- Diminished peripheral pulses
2. **Respiratory**: not directly affected, but failure or arrest may occur from muscle tetany or seizures affecting the respiratory muscles.
3. **Neuromuscular**:
	- Anxiety; irritability
	- Irritable skeletal muscles: twitches, cramps, tetanus, seizures; hyperactive deep tendon reflexes
	- Paresthesias followed by numbness that may affect the lips, nose, and ears in addition to the limbs
	- **Chvostek's Sign**: contraction of facial muscles in response to a light tap over the facial nerve in front of the ear.
	- **Trousseau's Sign**: a carpal spasm induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff above the systolic pressure for a few minutes.
4. **Renal**: urinary output varies depending on the cause
5. **Gastrointestinal**: increased gastric motility; hyperactive bowel sounds; cramping, diarrhea
6. **Laboratory Findings**: serum calcium level less than 9.0 mg/dL (2.25 mmol/L); ECG changes: prolonged ST and QT intervals
## Interventions
- **Check albumin levels**. Calcium binds to proteins, most prominently to albumin. A low albumin level may result in a reading of low serum calcium levels, despite no changes in total ionized calcium. If the client has a low albumin level, the calcium level should be corrected. It is determined through the formula $\text{serum calcium}+0.8(4-\text{serum albumin})$. Alternatively, the ionized calcium level can be checked, which has a normal value of 4.64 to 5.28 in adults.
- **Administer calcium supplements** orally or intravenously. When administering calcium intravenously, warm the injection solution to body temperature before administration. Administer slowly; monitor for ECG changes, infiltration, and hypercalcemia.
- **Administer medications that supplement calcium absorption**.
	- **Aluminum hydroxide** reduces phosphorus levels, causing the countereffect of increasing calcium levels.
	- **Vitamin D** aids in the absorption of calcium from the intestinal tract.
- Provide a **quiet environment** to reduce environmental stimuli.
- Initiate **seizure precautions**.
- Move the client carefully, and monitor for signs of **pathologic fractures**.
- Keep **10% calcium gluconate** available for treatment of acute calcium deficit.
- Instruct the client to **eat foods high in calcium**: dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt); tofu; green leafy vegetables (broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, bok choy); salmon and sardines; almonds, brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans; blackstrap molasses.

# Hypercalcemia
A serum calcium concentration that exceeds 10.5 mg/dL (2.75 mmol/L). Its causes include:
1. **Increased calcium absorption**: excessive oral intake of calcium and/or vitamin D
2. **Decreased calcium excretion**: kidney disease, the use of thiazide diuretics
3. **Increased bone resorption of calcium**: hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, malignancy (bone destruction from metastatic tumors), and immobility
4. **Hemoconcentration**: dehydration, lithium therapy, and adrenal insufficiency
## Assessment
1. **Cardiovascular**:
	- Increased heart rate in the early phase; bradycardia to cardiac arrest in late phases
	- Hypertension; bounding peripheral pulses
2. **Respiratory**: ineffective respiratory movements as a result of profound skeletal muscle weakness.
3. **Neuromuscular**:
	- Disorientation, lethargy, coma
	- Profound muscle weakness; diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes
4. **Renal**: urinary output varies depending on the cause
5. **Gastrointestinal**:
	- Decreased motility and hypoactive bowel sounds; constipation
	- Anorexia, nausea, abdominal distention
6. **Laboratory Findings**:
	- a serum calcium level greater than 10.5 mg/dL (2.75 mmol/L)
	- Shortened ST and QT intervals; widened T wave; heart block
## Interventions

>[!WARNING] Pathologic fractures are a risk for clients with calcium imbalances. Move them slowly and assist with ambulation.

- **Administer isotonic saline solutions** are prescribed. Discontinue IV infusions of solutions containing calcium and oral medications containing calcium or vitamin D
- **Thiazide diuretics may be discontinued** and replaced with diuretics that enhance the excretion of calcium
- Administer **medications as prescribed that inhibit calcium resorption** from the bone e.g. phosphorus, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid, nonsteroidal antiinflamatory medications)
- If severe, prepare for **dialysis** if it does not respond to treatment.
- **Move the client carefully** and monitor for **signs of pathologic fracture**
- Monitor for **flank or abdominal pain**, and strain the urine to check for the presence of urinary stones.
- **Avoid foods high in calcium**: dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese); tofu; green leafy vegetables (broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, bok choy); salmon and sardines; almonds, brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans; blackstrap molasses
