description: Retinal detachment is the separation of the retinal pigment epithelium from the neurosensory layer due to (a) tearing, (b) trauma, (c) traction, or (d) exudate formation.
---
The **separation of the retinal pigment epithelium** (RPE) **from the neurosensory layer**. There are four types:
1. **Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment**: the most common form, where **a hole or tear develops in the sensory retina, allowing liquid vitreous to seep through and detach the RPE**. People at risk for this form include those with high myopia or are aphakic. **Trauma** may also play a role. Between 5% to 10% of this form are from **proliferative retinopathy**, which is associated with **diabetic neovascularization**.
2. **Traction Retinal Detachment**: a tension or pulling force physically detaches the RPE from the neurosensory layer. In general, patients with this type have developed **fibrous scar tissue** that exert a pulling force on the delicate retina. This tissue may form in diabetic retinopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, or retinopathy of prematurity. All the **scars or bands of fibrous material providing traction are released**.
3. **Combined form of Retinal Detachment**
4. **Exudative Retinal Detachment**

# Clinical Manifestations
Patients feel no pain, but RD is an ocular emergency requiring immediate surgical intervention. Patients report a sensation of a **"*shade*" or "*curtain*" coming across the vision of one eye**, cobwebs, bright flashing lights, or the **sudden onset of a great number of floaters**.

___

# Diagnostic Examination
All degenerative changes, retinal breaks, and fibrous bands that may be causing traction on the retina must be identified.
- **Determine visual acuity**
- **Dilated fundus examination** using an **indirect ophthalmoscopy** an d **slit-lamp biomicroscopy**
- **Stereo fundus photography** and **fluorescein angiography** are commonly used.
- **Optical coherence tomography** and **ultrasound** are used for complete retinal assessment, especially if the view is blocked by a dense cataract or vitreal hemorrhage.

___

# Surgical Management
In **rhegmatogenous retinal detachment**, an attempt is made to surgically reattach the sensory retina to the RPE. In **traction retinal detachment**, an all sources of traction must be removed and the sensory retina reattached. The most common procedures include:
1. **Scleral Buckle**: the globe is compressed with a scleral buckle or silicone band to indent the scleral wall from the outside of the eye, bringing the two retinal layers in contact with each other.
2. **Vitrectomy**: a light source is introduced intraocularly through an incision, and a second incision allows for the vitrectomy. Traction may be relieved through vitrectomy, and may be combined with scleral buckling to repair retinal detachments. A **gas bubble**, **silicone oil**, or **perfluorocarbon** may be **injected into the vitreous cavity** to help push the sensory retina up against the RPE.

___

# Nursing Management
Educate the patient and provide supportive care.
- **Postoperatively**, if a **gas bubble** is used, the patient is **positioned prone to ensure the gas functions as a tamponade**, applying consistent pressure to reattach the sensory retina. Inform the patient and family prior to procedure to ensure maximal comfort.
- Complications may include **increased IOP**, **endophthalmitis**, **retinal detachment**, and **cataract development**. Educate the patient about the signs and symptoms of these complications (esp. IOP and infection).
