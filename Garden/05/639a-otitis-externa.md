Also known as *swimmer's ear*. It is an infection of the skin lining along the ear canal. It is often caused by a dermatosis (psoriasis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis), and even allergic reactions.
- **Incidence**: common in pre-school and school-age children.
- **Causative agents**: *Staphylococcus aureus*, **Pseudomonas sp.**, or sometimes the fungus Aspergillus can enter the ear canal from a scratch, injury, or if the ear is wet for a prolonged period of time. Systemic conditions (vitamin deficiency, endocrine disorders) may also be a cause.

# Clinical Manifestations
**Itching**, **pain** in the ear canal, **small amounts of clear discharge**, and occasionally a **fever** and/or **hearing loss**, cellulitis, and lymphadenopathy.
- **Diagnostic Examination**:
	- The auricle and ear canal appears **red and swollen**. The ear canal may appear to have eczema (scaly shedding of skin).
	- The outer ear is **tender**.
	- The eardrum may be obstructed because of swelling of the outer canal.
	- Growing **culture** from the clear discharge may identify the causative bacteria or fungus.

# Treatment
The goal is to cure the infection.
1. **Clean the canal of drainage** to allow topical medications to work effectively.
2. **Antimicrobial** or **antifungal** otic medications may be used. For bacterial infections, a combination of **antibiotics and corticosteroid otic drops** are used to fight infection, reduce itching, and reduce inflammation. It is used **abundantly** (4 or 5 drops at a time) in order to reach the end of the ear canal.
	- In severely obstructed ear canals, a **wick** may be used to facilitate the instillation of medicine.
3. **Analgesics** may be used for severe pain for the first 2 to 4 days.
4. A **Warm Compress** may reduce pain.
5. **Keep the ears clean and dry**, even during showering, shampooing, or bathing. Do not swim.

# Nursing Management
**Prevent infection**. Recurrence is highly likely unless the patient allows the external canal to heal completely.
- Inform the patient to avoid cleaning the external auditory canal with cotton-tipped applicators to avoid events that traumatize the external canal, such as scratching.
- Avoid getting the canal wet, even when bathing. A cotton ball covered in a water-insoluble gel (e.g. petrolatum jelly) can act as a barrier for the ear.
- Do not swim for 7 to 10 days after diagnosis.
- **Antiseptic otic preparations** after swimming can prevent infection (contraindicated in history of tympanic membrane perforation or on-going infection).
