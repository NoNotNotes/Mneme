A deficit of carbonic acid and a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration that results from the accumulation of base or from a loss of acid without a comparable loss of base in the body fluids. Its causes include:

| Cause                                                     | Description                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Diuretics                                                 | The loss of hydrogen ions and chloride from diuresis causes a compensatory increase in the amount of bicarbonate in the blood. |
| Excessive vomiting or GI suctioning                       | Leads to an excessive loss of hydrochloric acid.                                                                               |
| Hyperaldosteronism                                        | Increased renal tubular reabsorption of sodium occurs, with the resultant loss of hydrogen ions.                               |
| Ingestion of and/or infusion of excess sodium bicarbonate | Causes an increase in the amount of base in the blood.                                                                         |
| Massive transfusion of whole blood                        | The citrate anticoagulant used for the storage of blood is metabolized to bicarbonate.                                         |

___

# Assessment
1. **Neurological**: lethargy, irritability, confusion, headache
2. **Cardiovascular**: low blood pressure, tachycardia, dysrhythmias (same as in respiratory alkalosis)
3. **Gastrointestinal**: anorexia, nausea, vomiting
4. **Neuromuscular**: tetany, tremors, tingling of extremities, muscle cramps; hypertonic muscles, seizures
5. **Respiratory**: decreased respiratory rate and depth as compensation (hypoventilation)

___

# Intervention
- Monitor for signs of respiratory distress.
- Prepare to **administer medications and intravenous fluids** as prescribed to **promote the kidney excretion of bicarbonate**.
- Prepare to **replace potassium** as prescribed.
