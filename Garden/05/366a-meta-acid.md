___

A total concentration of buffer base that is lower than normal, with a relative increase in the hydrogen ion concentration, resulting from loss of too much base and/or retention of too much acid. Its causes include:

| Cause                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diabetes Mellitus                                                   | An insufficient insulin supply increases fat metabolism, leading to an excess accumulation of ketones or other acids; the bicarbonate ends up being depleted. |
| Excessive ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid                         | Increase in the hydrogen ion concentration.                                                                                                                   |
| High-fat diet                                                       | Rapid accumulation of the waste products of fat metabolism leads to a buildup of ketones and acids.                                                           |
| Insufficient metabolism of carbohydrates                            | When the oxygen supply is not sufficient for the metabolism of carbohydrates, lactic acid is produced, leading to acidosis.                                   |
| Malnutrition                                                        | Improper metabolism causes fat catabolism, which produces ketones and acids.                                                                                  |
| Renal insufficiency, acute kidney injury, or chronic kidney disease | Increased retention of waste products of protein metabolism; acids increase, and bicarbonate is unable to compensate.                                         |
| Severe diarrhea                                                     | The alkaline intestinal and pancreatic secretions are lost, leading to acidosis.                                                                              |

___

# Assessment
1. **Neurological**: lethargy, confusion, dizziness, headache, coma (same as with its respiratory counterpart)
2. **Cardiovascular**: decreased blood pressure; dysrhythmias (from hyperkalemia during compensation); and cold, clammy skin (only skin presentation varies from its respiratory counterpart\)
3. **Gastrointestinal**: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
4. **Neuromuscular**: muscle weakness, seizures
5. **Respiratory**: deep, rapid respirations (compensatory action by the lungs) known as **Kussmaul's respirations**.

___

# Interventions
- Monitor for signs of respiratory distress.
- Monitor intake and output and assist with **fluid and electrolyte replacement** as prescribed.
- Prepare to administer solutions intravenously as prescribed to **increase the buffer base**.
- For **diabetes mellitus** and **diabetic ketoacidosis** (DKA), **give insulin** as prescribed to decrease ketosis, **monitor for circulator collapse** caused by polyuria (osmotic diuresis), and **administer fluid volume resuscitation** for DKA; monitor electrolytes, glucose, and urinary output during administration.
- For **kidney disease**, **dialysis** may be necessary to remove waste products. A **diet low in protein and high in calories** decreases the resulting amount of protein waste products.
