description: Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluids within the lung's alveoli, decreasing perfusion and resulting in systematic hypoxia, tachypnea, and foamy sputum.
---
Often resulting from left-sided ventricular failure, pulmonary congestion results in pulmonary edema, leading to decreased perfusion.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: cerebral hypoxia (LOC changes), systematic hypoxia (cyanosis, cool skin), weak pulses + tachycardia, incessant coughing with foamy/frothy (maybe pink/blood-tinged) sputum.
- **Diagnostics**: LSHF, crackles/rales, CXR (increased interstitial markings), pulse oximetry (ABG)
- **Medical Management**: reduce volume overload (diuresis), improve ventricular function (inotropes), and increase respiratory exchange (oxygenation, medication)
- **Pharmacologic Therapy**: morphine (reduce anxiety, antidote is naloxone hydrochloride/Narcan), diuretics (reduce fluid volume), and vasodilators (nitroglycerin)
- **Nursing Interventions**: Assist in oxygenation, intubation, and ventilation. Position patient upright with feet down to promote circulation. Regularly evaluate medication effects.
