An inflammation of the conjunctiva. It is a common ocular disorder worldwide, characterized by a **pink appearance** (hence its name "*pink eye*") because of subconjunctival blood vessel congestion.

___

# Clinical Manifestations
General symptoms include **foreign-body sensation**, **scratching or burning sensation**, **itching**, and **photophobia**. It may be unilateral or bilateral, but the infection usually starts in one eye then spreads to the other eye through hand contact.

___

# Diagnostic Examination
Diagnosis is based on the distinctive characteristics of ocular signs, acute or chronic presentation, and identification of any precipitating events. **Positive results of swab smear preparations and cultures confirm the diagnosis**. The four **main clinical features** important to evaluate are:
1. **Discharge**: determine if the discharge is **watery**, **mucoid**, **purulent**, or **mucopurulent**.
2. **Conjunctival Reaction**: determine if the reaction is **follicular** or **papillary**.
	- **Follicles** are multiple, slightly elevated lesions encircled by tiny blood vessels. They appear **like grains of rice**.
	- **Papillae** are hyperplastic conjunctival epithelium in numerous projections that are usually seen as a **fine mosaic pattern** under slit-lamp examination.
3. **Pseudomembranes or True Membranes**: pseudomembranes consist of **coagulated exudate** that adheres to the surface of the inflamed conjunctiva. **True membranes** form when the exudate adhered to the superficial layer of the conjunctiva, and removal results in bleeding.
4. **Lymphadenopathy**: enlargement of the periauricular and submandibular lymph nodes where the eyelids drain.

# Types of Conjunctivitis
1. **Bacterial Conjunctivitis**: acute or chronic; acute may become chronic.
	- Signs and symptoms vary from mild to severe: **acute onset of redness, burning, and discharge**. There is **pupillary formation**, **conjunctival irritation**, and **injection in the fornices**. Exudates are variable but are commonly present in the morning.
	- **Exudates** may cause adhesion, producing difficulty in opening the eyes. **Mucopurulent** discharge is seen in mild cases, while **purulent** discharge appear in severe acute bacterial infections.
	- Chronic form is often seen in patients with lacrimal duct obstruction, chronic dacryocystitis, and chronic blepharitis.
	- In **gonococcal conjunctivitis**, the symptoms appear more acute, exudate is profuse and purulent, and lymphadenopathy occurs. Pseudomembranes may be present.
	- **Trachoma** from *Chlamydia trachomatis* is the leading cause of preventable blindness, spread by direct contact or by carriers (insects).
	- *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*
2. **Viral Conjunctivitis**: acute or chronic.
	- Signs and symptoms vary from mild to severe: **tearing**, **redness**, **foreign-body sensation**, **lid edema**, **ptosis**, and conjunctival **hyperemia** (red eyes caused by dilation of blood vessels).
	- Symptoms of **upper respiratory tract infection** often precede the condition.
	- **Discharge is watery**, and **follicles are prominent**. Severe cases include **pseudomembranes**.
	- **Corneal involvement** produces photophobia
	- Adenovirus (highly contagious) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).
	- Vital conjunctivitis is **self-limiting** but lasts longer than bacterial conjunctivitis.
	- **Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis** is a seasonal outbreak of epidemics, especially during summer as people use swimming pools. This is often accompanied by **periauricular lymphadenopathy** and occasionally periorbital pain. There are marked **follicular and papillary formations**. This may lead to **keratopathy**.
3. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: a hypersensitivity reaction as a part of **allergic rhinitis**, or independent. A history is often present (pollens, other environmental allergens). **Extreme pruritus**, **epiphora** (excessive secretion of tears), injection, and usually **severe photophobia**. A **string-like mucoid discharge** is usually associated with rubbing the eyes because of severe pruritus.
	- **Vernal conjunctivitis** is also known as **seasonal conjunctivitis** because it appears mostly during warm weather, and in children and young adults. Most affect people have a history of asthma or eczema. There may be **large formations of papillae** that have a **cobblestone appearance**.
4. **Toxic Conjunctivitis**: potentially as a result of medications; chlorine from swimming pools; exposure to toxic fumes among industrial workers; or exposure to other irritants such as smoke, hair sprays, acids, and alkalis.

# Medical Management
1. **Bacterial Conjunctivitis**: acute forms are **almost always self-limiting**, lasting two weeks if left untreated. If treated with antibiotic agents, it may last a few days (except for gonococcal and staphylococcal conjunctivitis).
	- **Trachoma** is treated with broad-spectrum oral and systemic antibiotics. **Surgical management** includes **correction of trichiasis** to prevent conjunctival scarring.
	- **Adult inclusion conjunctivitis** requires 1 week of antibiotics. **Prevention of reinfection** is important. Affected people and their sexual partners should seek treatment for STIs if indicated.
2. **Viral Conjunctivitis**: not responsive to any treatment. Patients should be made aware of the contagious nature of the disease (esp. for highly contagious forms like epidemic keratoconjunctivitis).
	- **Cold compress** may alleviate some symptoms.
	- **Health care-associated infections should be prevented**. Frequent hand hygiene and procedures for environmental cleaning and disinfection of equipment used for eye examination must be strictly followed at all times. **Patients suspected of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus should have their own specific areas** for treatment during an adenovirus conjunctivitis outbreak.
	- **Isolation for 3 to 7 days** (until symptoms resolve) is prescribed for employees who are infection.
3. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: **corticosteroids** in ophthalmic preparations are given. Depending on severity, they may be oral. The use of **vasoconstrictors**, such as **topical epinephrine solution**, **cold compresses, ice packs, and cool ventilation** usually provide comfort by **decreasing swelling**.
4. **Toxic Conjunctivitis**: **profuse irrigation with saline or sterile water**.
