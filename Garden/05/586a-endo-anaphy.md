description: The endocrine system is a complex network of glands and organs that produce and release hormones directly into the bloodstream. These hormones act as chemical messengers, coordinating various bodily functions like growth, metabolism, reproduction, and mood.

**Hormones** are the chemical messengers that allow the endocrine system to fulfill its functions. These substances regulate and integrate body functions by acting upon target sites.
1. **Glands**: the secretory tissues of the endocrine system, most often being released directly into the blood streams; the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, pancreatic islets, ovaries, and testes. There are also exocrine glands such as sweat glands that secrete products onto epithelial surfaces or the GI tract.
2. **Regulation**: hormones in circulation are regulated based on their unique function and the body's needs. In a healthy individual, most hormones maintain a relatively constant level. To prevent accumulation, a **negative feedback system** inhibits or permits hormone production once hormone concentration becomes excessive or inadequate.
3. **Hormones**: hormones exert precise control over many of the body's physiologic functions. They are divided into four categories based on structure:
	1. Amines and amino acids: epinephrine, norepinephrine, thyroid hormones
	2. Peptides, polypeptides, proteins, glycoproteins: thyrotropin-releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, growth hormone
	3. Steroids: corticosteroids
	4. Fatty acid derivatives: eicosanoid, retinoids
