Heart failure is the loss of pumping ability of the heart. It may be categorized as Left-Sided or Right-Sided Heart Failure (LSHF, RSHF). There are many causes, but in terms of physiological changes:
- Preload is greatly reduced (e.g. hypovolemia)
- Preload is greatly increased (e.g. hypervolemia, pancytopenia)
- Afterload is obstructed or difficult (e.g. valvular stenosis/regurgitation, hypertension)
- Damage to the heart muscle (e.g. cardiomyopathy, M.I.)
- Increased metabolic states (e.g. Hyperthyroidism, Graves Disease, Pheochromocytoma)

# Compensatory Mechanisms of the Heart
Once the heart reaches its physical limit, cardiac decompensation occurs.
1. **Ventricular Dilatation**
2. **Ventricular Hypertrophy**
3. **Sympathetic Nervous System Stimulation** â†’ Tachycardia

___

# Manifestations
## Left-Sided Heart Failure
LSHF will always be followed by RSHF if left untreated.
- Forward Effect: Decreased Systemic Perfusion (Cerebral, Renal, Body Cells)
- Backward Effect: Pulmonary Congestion and Edema
## Right-Sided Heart Failure
- Backward Effect: Systemic Congestion (Distended Jugular Veins, Increased CVP, Hepatosplenomegaly) and Edema (Dependent Edema, Ascites, Generalized Edema), Increased SGPT & SGOT (Impaired Liver Function), Anorexia and G.I. Distress

___

# Assessment
- **Heart/Lung Sounds**: "**galloping horse**", crackles/rales (blowing into a can of soda with a straw).
- The patient feels like they are drowning.

___

# Diagnostic Findings
- **CXR**: **Cardiomegaly**
- **Pleural Effusion**
- **ECG**: ventricular hypertrophy, dysrhythmias
- **ECHO**: reveals cardiac valvular changes, pericardial effusions, chamber enlargement, and ventricular hypertrophy.

___

# Medical Management
1. **Low Na<sup>+</sup>** Diet and **Fluid Restrictions**
2. **Inotropic Agents**: Increased contractility, slows heart rate and conduction.
	- **Digoxin** (Lanoxin): the mainstay treatment for HF.
		- Also decreases sympathetic activity and increases parasympathetic activity.
		- Always check for digitalis toxicity (0.5 to 2 ng/mL), the main presenting symptom of which is bradycardia, along with anorexia, N&V, rapid, slow, irregular heart rate, and disturbance in color vision.
		- Antidote: **Digibind**
		- Do not administer if assessment is found to be <60 BPM and supplement potassium if patient is hypokalemic.
	- **Dopamine** (Intropin), **Dobutamine** (Dobutrex)
3. **Diuretics**: **Furosemide** (Lasix), **Chlorothiazide** (Diuril)
	- Inhibition loss of sodium means potassium is exchanged and excreted in turn. A serum test is done prior to usage of **Furosemide**, and supplementation is ordered if hypokalemic. Hypokalemia also contributes to digitalis toxicity due to its direct effect on cardiac contraction.
4. **Vasodilators**: **Nitroglycerin**
5. **ACE Inhibitors**: "-*pril*s"

___

# Nursing Management
Most clients manage chronic heart failure at home.
- Administer prescriptions and evaluate effect.
- Promote positive cardiac output.
- Monitor for excess fluid volume (weight gain) and electrolyte imbalances (potassium)
- Promote oxygenation and balance activity according to tolerance.
