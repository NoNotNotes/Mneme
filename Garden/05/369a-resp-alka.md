description: A deficit of carbonic acid and a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration that results from the accumulation of base or from a loss of acid without a comparable loss of base in the body fluids. Its causes include conditions that cause overstimulation of the respiratory system.

A deficit of carbonic acid and a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration that results from the accumulation of base or from a loss of acid without a comparable loss of base in the body fluids. Its causes include conditions that cause overstimulation of the respiratory system:

| Cause                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Fever                                     | Causes increased metabolism, resulting in overstimulation of the respiratory system.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hyperventilation                          | Rapid respirations causing the blowing off of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), leading to a decrease in carbonic acid.                                                                                                               |
| Hypoxia                                   | Stimulates the respiratory center in the brainstem, which causes an increase in respiratory rate in order to increase oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>); this causes hyperventilation, which results in a decrease in the CO<sub>2</sub> level. |
| Overventilation by mechanical ventilators | The administration of O<sub>2</sub> and depletion of CO<sub>2</sub> can occur from mechanical ventilation, causing the client to be hyperventilated.                                                                                 |
| Pain                                      | Overstimulation of the respiratory center in the brain stem results in a carbonic acid deficit.                                                                                                                                      |
| Severe anxiety and hysteria               | Often is neurogenic and related to a psychoneurosis; however, this condition leads to vigorous breathing and excessive exhaling of CO<sub>2</sub>.                                                                                   |

# Assessment
1. **Neurological**: dizziness, light-headedness, confusion, headache
2. **Cardiovascular**: low blood pressure, tachycardia, dysrhythmias
3. **Gastrointestinal**: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; epigastric pain
4. **Neuromuscular**: tetany, numbness, tingling of extremities, hyperreflexia, seizures
5. **Respiratory**: decreased respiratory rate and depth as compensation. If unable to compensate, hyperventilation occurs

___

# Interventions
- Monitor for signs of respiratory distress.
- Provide emotional support and reassurance to the client.
- Encourage **appropriate breathing patterns**.
- Assist with **breathing techniques and aids** if needed and as prescribed; voluntary breath holding, using a rebreathing mask, CO<sub>2</sub> breaths with rebreathing into a paper bag.
- Provide **cautious care with ventilator clients** so they are not forced to take breaths too deeply or rapidly.
- Prepare to **administer calcium gluconate for tetany** as prescribed.
