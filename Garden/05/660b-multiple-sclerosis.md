**MS** is an immune-mediated, progressive demyelinating disease of the CNS. **Demyelination** is the destruction or loss of the **myelin**, a fatty and protein material that surrounds certain nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in impaired nerve impulse transmission.
- **20 to 50** years of age, but can occur at any age.
- **Women** three times more often than in men.

# Clinical Manifestations
- **Fatigue, depression, weakness, numbness, dystaxia, loss of balance, spasticity, and pain** are all common.
- Visual disturbances from lesions in the optic nerves or their connections: **blurring of vision**, **diplopia**, **scotoma** (patchy blindness), and **total blindness**. Visual changes are among the early manifestations of MS.
- **Ataxia** and **Tremors** may result from involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia.
- **Cognitive and psychosocial problems** may reflect involvement of the frontal or parietal lobes. Some degree of cognitive change (memory loss, impaired concentration) is found in half of patients.
- **Emotional lability and euphoria** may result from the loss of control connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia.
- **Bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunctions** are common. UTIs, constipation, pressure injuries, contracture deformities, dependent pedal edema, pneumonia, osteoporosis, and emotional, social, marital, economic, and vocational problems may also occur.

# Diagnostic Examination
Diagnosis is based on clinical, **imaging**, and laboratory findings. With no definitive test for MS, diagnosis involves the **presence of plaques in the CNS disseminated in space and over time** observed on MRI scans with no better explanation for the clinical presentation.

| Body Function       | Diagnosis                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Immune System       | CSF Electrophoresis        |
| Neuron Transmission | Evoked Potential Studies   |
| Muscle              | Urodynamic Studies         |
| Cognitive Function  | Neuropsychological Testing |

# Management
1. **Medical**: there is no cure for MS. An individual treatment program provides symptomatic relief and support, especially for patients with cognitive impairment. Goals are to (a) **delay the progression of the disease**, (b) **manage chronic symptoms**, and (c) **treat acute exacerbations**. Symptoms requiring intervention include ataxia, bladder dysfunction, depression, fatigue, and spasticity.
2. **Pharmacologic**:
	- **Disease-Modifying** therapies reduce the frequency or duration of relapse, and the number and size of plaques observed on MRI in RRMS. The same therapies are not effective in PPMS.
		- **Interferon**
		- **Glatiramer acetate** to reduce relapses.
		- **Teriflunomide, fingolimod, and dimethyl fumarate** are oral disease-modifying therapies that may be better tolerated by patients who have difficulty with injection reactions.
		- **IV methylprednisolone** is used to treat acute exacerbations, shortening the duration of relapse, but have no long term benefit. Anti-inflammatory effects act on T cells and cytokines.

Otherwise, therapies are mainly in place to manage symptoms.

| Symptoms                                   | Medication                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spasticity**                             | **Baclofen** oral or intrathecal (for severe spasticity), a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, treats **spasticity**.                                            |
| **Spasticity, Debilitated Motor Function** | **Benzodiazepines** (Diazepam), **Tizanidine**, and **Dantrolene** may also be used to **treat spasticity and improve motor function**.                               |
| **Fatigue**                                | **Amantadine**, **Pemoline**, **Dalfampridine** can help with debilitating **fatigue**.                                                                               |
| **Ataxia**                                 | **Beta-adrenergic Blockers** (Propanolol), **Gabapentin** (an anticonvulsant), and **Benzodiazepines** (Clonazepam) is used to treat **ataxia**.                      |
| **Bladder and Bowel Problems**             | **Anticholinergic agents, alpha-adrenergic blockers, antispasmodic agents**: may be used for **bladder and bowel problems**. Non-pharmacologic solutions may be used. |
| **UTI**                                    | **Antibiotic agents** (when appropriate) are used for **UTI** that superimposes over underlying neurologic dysfunction.                                               |

# Nursing Care Management
**Address neurologic deficits**. Observe **mobility** and **balance** for **fall risk assessment**. Perform assessments both for when the patient is rested and when the patient is fatigued.
1. **Promoting Physical Mobility**
	- **Exercise**: walking improves gait, especially in relation to loss of proprioception. Assistive devices may also be used. Muscle stretching minimizes contractures; especially for hamstrings, gastrocnemius muscles, hip adductors, biceps, and wrist and finger flexors.
	- **Minimizing Spasticity and Contractures**: warm packs are beneficial, but hot is not advised due to burn risks (especially secondary to sensory loss). Prescribed orthotics help maintain a functional position and reduce contractures. A "*stretch-hold-relax*" routine is helpful for spasticity. Swimming and stationary bicycling is helpful.
	- **Activity and Rest**: work and exercise just short of fatigue is encouraged. Frequent short rest periods is advised. Exposure to heat increases fatigue and muscle weakness, so air conditioning is recommended.
	- **Nutrition**: many patients with MS are obese or overweight. Corticosteroids used for acute exacerbations contribute to weight gain. Lifestyle changes should be made for weight reduction. Avoidance of alcohol and cigarette smoking are also included.
2. **Preventing Falls**: ataxia produces a risk for falls.
	- The patient is **instructed to walk with feet apart** to widen the base of support and to increase walking stability.
	- **If proprioception is lost**, the patient is instructed to **watch their feet while they walk**.
	- **Assistive devices** may be required. If gait remains inefficient, the use of a wheelchair or motorized scooter may be the solution. Coordinate with the physical therapist. Wheelchairs can contribute to risk for pressure injuries.
	- If **intention tremors** are noted, wrist weights or neuromodulation devices may be used.
3. **Managing Fatigue**: fatigue is found in 60% to 90% of patients, but etiology remains unclear. It is often **the most disabling symptom** and **the most common reason for cessation of employment**. It has been found that decreasing the usage of electronic devices can help sleep quality and reduce fatigue.
