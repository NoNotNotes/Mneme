**Pneumonia** is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. Pneumonia and influenza are the most common causes of death from infectious diseases in the United States. Pneumonia can be classified into four types: **community-acquired pneumonia** (CAP), **health care–associated pneumonia** (HCAP), **hospital-acquired pneumonia** (HAP), and **ventilator-associated pneumonia** (VAP).

>[!EXAMPLE] Classifications and Definitions of Pneumonias
>1. **Community-Acquired Pneumonia** (CAP): Pneumonia occurring in the community or ≤48 hours after hospital admission or institutionalization of patients who do not meet.
>2. **Health care-Associated Pneumonia** (HCAP): Pneumonia occurring in a nonhospitalized patient with extensive health care contact.
>3. **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia** (HAP): Pneumonia occurring ≥48 hours after hospital admission that did not appear to be incubating at the time of admission.
>4. **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia** (VAP): a type of HAP that develops ≥48 hours after endotracheal tube intubation.

# Community-Acquired Pneumonia
CAP, a common infectious disease, occurs either in the community setting or within the first 48 hours after hospitalization or institutionalization. The need for hospitalization for CAP depends on the severity of the pneumonia.
