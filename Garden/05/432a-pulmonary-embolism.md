A dislodged thrombus makes its way to one of the arteries of the lungs.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: dyspnea and tachypnea. Chest pain is common and is pleuritic in nature.
- **Diagnostics**: CXR, ECG, ABG, Ventilation-Perfusion Scan, Angiography (best), Spiral CT
- **Prevention**: ambulation, sequential compression devices, anticoagulant therapy
- **Medical Management**: stabilize the cardiopulmonary system. Diuretics, antiarrhythmics, vasodilators (dobutamine), oxygen, sedatives (morphine), anticoagulants (heparin, coumadin), thrombolytics (streptokinase)
- **Surgical Management**: embolectomy (rare, but may be used for massive PE)
- **Nursing Interventions**: minimize PE risk (ambulation, exercise, positioning), monitor anticoagulant/thrombolytic therapy (check PT/PTT time frequently), minimize chest pain (positioning, analgesia), oxygenation (pulse oximetry, spirometry, breathing patterns), nebulizer therapy/secretion management
