The list of topics included in this list is primarily based on Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing. I've removed some topics I personally don't believe will be appearing on the board exam, but I'll check other content outlines to determine if I have any missing topics.

>[!TIP] What are Ratings?
>**Ratings** are based on a very limited sample size of lecturers (four!) who have rated a topic's **relevance to the board exam** from the options "*Low Priority*" (1), "*Nice to Know*" (3), and "*Must Know*" (5). I'll keep asking around for more input from reviewers!
