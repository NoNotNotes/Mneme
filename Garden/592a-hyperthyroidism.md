A hyperthyroid state resulting from hypersecretion of the thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine). It may be caused by:
- **Graves' Disease**: autoimmune derivation; circulating anti-TSH autoantibodies that **displace TSH from and activate the thyroid receptors**.
	- Associated with **Hashimoto's Disease** a state of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland that *usually* causes hypothyroidism.
- **Thyrotoxicosis** (excessive thyroid hormones) may result from autoimmune diseases, functional thyroid adenomas, and infection.
___
# Complications
1. **Thyrotoxicosis**, or a **Thyroid Crisis**/**Thyroid Storm** is a sudden exacerbation of symptoms of hyperthyroidism that often occur with infection or stress. Immediate hospitalization is required.
	- **Fever**
	- **Decreased Mental Alertness**
	- **Abdominal Pain**
2. **Heart-related Complications**: tachycardia, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation
3. **Increased risk for osteoporosis** in long-lasting hyperthyroidism.
4. **Complications secondary to surgical management**:
	- Scarring of the neck
	- Vocal hoarseness due to nerve damage to the voice box.
	- Hypocalcemia due to parathyroid damage.
5. **Complications secondary to other managements**: radioactive iodine, and hormone replacement therapy also have other potential complications.
# Assessment Findings
1. **Enlarged Thyroid Gland** (Goiter) e.g. in Graves' disease, autoimmune disorders
2. **Palpitations**, **Cardiac Dysrhythmias** (tachycardia or even atrial fibrillation in severe cases), **Hypertension**, increased cardiac output: increased thyroid hormones stimulate the heart.
3. **Exophthalmos** (bulging eyes) may be present, particularly in those with Graves' disease. This results from swelling of the tissues around the eyes.
4. **Heat Intolerance**: increased body heat results in being less tolerance even to warm environments.
5. **Diaphoresis**: heightened metabolic activity and body temperature.
6. **Weight Loss**: heightened metabolic activity results in increased energy expenditure despite an increase in appetite.
7. **Diarrhea**: gastrointestinal motility may be enhanced by hyperthyroidism.
8. **Smooth and soft skin and hair**: thyroid hormones stimulate skin cell regeneration and hair keratin production (integumentary effects).
9. **Nervousness**, **Fine Tremors of the Hands**: nervous system stimulation by the thyroid hormones.
10. **Personality Changes**, **Mood Swings**, **Irritability**, and **Agitation**: neurotransmitters in the brain and the nervous interact with thyroid hormones.
11. **Oligomenorrhea** (irregular menstrual periods) as thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle.
___
# Diagnostic Examination
- **Primary Nursing Diagnosis**: Activity intolerance related to exhaustion and fatigue.
- **TSH Assay** reveals decreased levels (normally 0.5 to 1.5 mU/L) of TSH as the body attempts to regulate elevated thyroid hormones.
- **T<sub>3</sub>** and **T<sub>4</sub>** radioimmunoassay show elevations reflecting overproduction. These values are also used to monitor effect of therapy.
	- Triiodothyronine levels are normally 80 to 230 ng/dL. These levels are lower than T<sub>4</sub> as T<sub>3</sub> has a greater effect on the body.
	- Thyroxine levels are normally 5.0 to 12.0 Î¼g/dL.
- 24 hour Radioactive Iodine Uptake
- Thyroid Autoantibody Testing
- Antithyroglobulin
- Electrocardiogram
___
# Medical Management
(a) **Reduction of thyroid hyperactivity** for symptomatic relief and (b) **removing the cause of complications**
1. **Irradiation** via radioactive Iodine (<sup>131</sup>I or <sup>123</sup>I) of overactive thyroid cells. This is the most common form of treatment for the elderly, but is **contraindicated in pregnancy and nursing mothers**. Iodine may cross the placenta and is secreted in breast milk.
2. **Pharmacotherapy**: **Antithyroid** medications that **inhibit hormone synthesis/release** or **reduce the amount of thyroid tissue**.
	- **Propylthiouracil; PTU (Propacil)** and **Methimazole (Tapazole)** are the most common, used until thyroid hormones are normal. Both of these drugs inhibits the ability of the thyroid to utilize iodine. A **maintenance dose** is established followed by a gradual withdrawal for several months. **Contraindicated for late pregnancy** due to risk for **goiter and cretinism in the fetus**.
3. **Surgery**: removal of most of the thyroid gland; no longer the preferred choice of therapy for Graves' disease, but is still used for patients who **cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs**, have **significant ophthalmopathy**, have **large goiters**, or cannot undergo **radioiodine therapy**.
## Adjunctive Therapy
1. **Potassium Iodide**, **Lugol's Solution**, and **Saturated Solution of Potassium Iodide** (SSKI) may also be added to induce the **Wolff-Chaikoff Effect**, a protective mechanism as a result of elevated iodine levels, where thyroid peroxidase (used for synthesis of hormones) downregulation occurs to prevent excessive production from iodine saturation.
2. **Beta-Adrenergic Agents** (Propanolol) may be used to **reduce effects of hyperthyroidism on the sympathetic nervous system** e.g. nervousness, tachycardia, tremors, anxiety, and heat intolerance.
___
# Nursing Interventions
1. Provide **adequate rest** (activity intolerance)
2. Administer **sedatives** as prescribed.
3. Provide a cool and quiet environment
4. Obtain **daily weight**.
5. Provide a high-calorie diet (increased metabolism)
6. Administer **antithyroid medications**, **iodine preparations**, or **propanolol** as prescribed.
7. Prepare for **radioactive iodine therapy** as ordered.
8. Prepare for **thyroidectomy** as ordered.
9. **Artificial Tears** are given to prevent corneal ulceration due to exophthalmos.
## Documentation
- **Physical Findings**: cardiovascular status (resting pulse, blood pressure, presence of angina or palpitations), bowel activity, edema, condition of skin, activity tolerance, **hypermetabolism**, **eye status**, **heat intolerance**.
- **Medication Response**, skin care regimen, nutrition, body weight, comfort level
- **Psychosocial Response** to changes in bodily function, mental acuity, **behavioral patterns**, emotional stability.
## Discharge Education
- **Disease Process**: the role of the thyroid gland, disease, treatment plan, and its side effects.
- **Medications**: thorough explanation of all medications (dosage, route, action, adverse effects, monitoring).
	- Take **PTU or Methimazole with meals** to limit gastric irritation.
	- Mix **iodine solutions with milk or juice** to limit gastric irritation. **Use a straw** to minimize risk for teeth discoloration.
- **Complications**: have the patient report any manifestations of **thyrotoxicosis** (tachycardia, palpitations, shakiness, tremors, DOB, N&V), **neck swelling**, **dysphagia**, or **weight loss** immediately.
