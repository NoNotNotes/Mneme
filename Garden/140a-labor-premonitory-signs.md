1. **Lightening**: the descent/dipping, dropping of the presenting part to the true pelvis. **Engagement is not the same as lightening**. The head is said to be "engaged" when the largest diameter of the presenting part passes through the pelvic inlet or the pelvic brim. This occurs earlier in primigravidas, at **one to two weeks before labor**, and later in multigravidas, at **one to two days before labor**. There are various signs of lightening:
	- **Relief of dyspnea**
	- **Relief of abdominal tightness**
	- **Increased frequency of urination**, varicosities, and pedal edema because of pressure on the bladder and pelvic girdle
	- **Shooting pains down the legs because of the pressure on the sciatic nerves**
	- **Increased amount of vaginal discharge**
2. **Braxton Hicks Contractions** are another sign, beginning 3 to 4 weeks before labor. They are painless and false labor contractions, appearing intermittently, irregularly, and non-progressively. They do not progress cervical dilatation or effacement, produce abdominal (not lumbosacral) discomfort, and can be relieved by walking and edema. They last anywhere from 30 to 120 seconds, maybe feeling like a wide belt tightening around the front of the abdomen.
3. **Increased maternal energy/burst of energy because of the hormone epinephrine**
4. **Slight decrease in maternal weight** by 2 to 3 lbs, 1 to 2 days before labor. Before labor, there is a drop in the blood level of progesterone, a water-retaining hormone, causing the excretion of retained fluid.
5. **Show**: blood-tinged mucus discharged from the cervix shortly before or during labor.
6. **Ripening of the Cervix**: becomes soft as butter.
7. **Rupture of the Bag of Waters**: an occasional sign. It is an indication for hospitalization.
8. **Progressive Fetal Descent**
9. **Increased backache and sacroiliac pressure** due to fetal pressure.
