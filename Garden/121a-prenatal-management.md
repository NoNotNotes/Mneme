**Prenatal checkups** are done to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. It aims to **define the health status of the mother and fetus**, the **gestational age of the fetus and the estimated date of confinement** (EDC), **initiate a nursing care plan** for continuing maternity care for both the mother and the fetus, and **detect any high-risk conditions early**. The **first visit** should be held as soon as the mother misses a menstrual period when pregnancy is suspected. Following this, the schedule of visits are:

| Trimester     | DOH (4 total visits)         | WHO (14 total visits) | RPS (14 total visits)                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st Trimester | Once before the fourth month | Once a month          | Once a month                                                        |
| 2nd Trimester | Once before the sixth month  | Once every two weeks  | Once a month                                                        |
| 3rd Trimester | Once before the eighth month | Once a week           | Once a month (to 8th month), then twice a month for the third month |
| Final Month   | Once on the final month      | Once                  | Once a week on the final month (36th to 40th week)                  |
Frequency increases if danger signals are present, or if known risk factors are established.

# Conducting Visits
Prenatal visits are done to serve as a basis for comparison (**baseline data collection**) with information gathered on subsequent visits. These function to screen for risk factors during pregnancy. For the initial visit, obtain the woman's:
1. **Obstetrical History**:
	- **Menstrual History**: menarche, regularity, duration, frequency, character
	- **Last Menstrual Period**, **Sexual History**, and **Methods of Contraception**
	- **Past Menstrual Period**
2. **Medical and Surgical History**: past illnesses, surgical procedures, and drugs currently being used.
3. **Family History**: to detect illnesses or conditions that are transmissible or hereditary.
4. **Current Problems**: activities of daily living, discomforts, danger signs.
5. **Vital Signs**: temperature, cardiac rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure
	- Temperature becomes elevated by progesterone and basal metabolic rate, not to reach 38°C.
	- Cardiac rate increases by 10 to 15 BPM during pregnancy.
	- Respiratory rate at rest can increase to 24 respirations/min.
	- Blood pressure is rarely affected, but hypotension can occur due to **supine hypotension syndrome**/**vena caval syndrome**. Prevention of this syndrome is through the use of a left-lateral recumbent position. **Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension** (PIH)is an important problem of pregnancy.
		- The **roll-over test** can be done in the first trimester for early detection of developing PIH by 20 to 24 weeks. Place the mother in the LLR position, check BP until stable (may take 10 to 15 minutes), then roll to supine. Check BP right away, then again in 5 minutes. If an increase between the two recordings exceeds 20 mm Hg, the woman is at risk (positive roll-over test).
6. **Weight** is checked every visit. Weight gain pattern should be monitored to determine any abnormalities. This is more important than the amount of weight gain; failure to gain weight is an ominous sign. The prepregnant weight is ideally from 90 to 150 lbs. Normal weight gain patterns contribute to the health of the mother and fetus. The total expected weight gain of **20 to 25, max of 35 lbs.** is gained as follows:
	- **First Trimester**: 1 lb. every month, 3 to 4 lbs. in total
	- **Second Trimester**: 0.9 to 1 lb. every week, 10 to 12 lbs. in total
	- **Third Trimester**: 0.5 to 1 lb. every week, 8 to 11 lbs. in total.
7. **Urine Testing**: Benedict's test (ideally at most 1+), Acetic Acid Test (should be negative)
8. **Fetal Growth and Development Assessment**
9. **Obstetrical History**: A.K.A. OB Scoring; a record of preceding pregnancies and perinatal outcomes. Multiple systems are used:
	- **4-Point System (FPAL)**:
		- Full-term: number of full-term births
		- Premature: number of premature births
		- Abortion: number of abortions
		- Living: number of currently living children
	- **5-Point System (GFPAL)**: the addition of **Gravida** (number of pregnancies) to the 4-Point system.
	- **7-Point System (GPTPALM)**:
		- **Gravida**: number of pregnancies
		- **Parity/Para**: number of deliveries
		- **Term**: number of term children delivered
		- **Preterm**: number of preterm children delivered
		- **Abortion**: number of abortions, not counted as deliveries
		- **Living**: number of currently living children
		- **Multiple**: number of pregnancies with multiple fetuses
10. **Estimates of Pregnancy**
11. **Age of Gestation**
12. **Complete Physical Examination**
13. **Laboratory Testing**
___
# Complete Physical Examination
**Internal Examination** is done to detect **early signs of pregnancy**: Chadwick's, Goodell's, and Hegar's sign. The following are the preparations for IE:
1. **Explanation** of the procedure
2. **Voiding** before IE
3. **Proper positioning**: Lithotomy; remember to set stirrups at equal height, avoiding pressure on the popliteal region, and to place legs on stirrups simultaneously.
4. **Draping**
5. **Instructions** for the patient: place the hands across the chest; correct breathing with slow, chest breaths.
>[!WARNING]
>- Do **not** perform any activity that increases intra-abdominal pressure.
>- Do **not** distract a woman's attention from focused breathing/relaxation techniques.
>- Avoid any impediment to communication.

**Important concerns for physical examinations** also include:
- **Breasts**: changes, adequacy for breastfeeding, or other abnormal signs
- **Abdomen**: fundal height, **Leopold's Maneuver**
- **Pelvimetry**: done in the third trimester to determine potential cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)
- **Extremities**: leg cramps, varicosities, pedal edema (discomforts), and **Homan's sign** (calf pain upon dorsiflexion), a danger sign of pregnancy.

>[!column]
>**Leopold's Maneuver** is a systematic abdominal palpation to estimate fetal size, locate fetal back and parts, and determine fetal position and presentation.
>1. **Explain** the procedure and its purpose.
>2. **Position**: dorsal recumbent with knees slightly flexed to relax the abdominal muscles.
>3. **Draping**
>4. **Examining hands should be warm** to avoid contractions of the abdominal muscles, which may impede palpation.
>5. **Apply gentle, firm palpations with the palms** of the hands.
>
>The steps are divided into four:
>6. **Palpate the fundus**; check for breech or cephalic; usually breech— soft, globular, non-ballotable.
>7. **Palpate the sides of the abdomen**; check for a smooth, resistant back and irregular, small fetal parts of the fetus. The area of the fetal back is the **best site for FHT auscultation**.
>8. **Palpate the area just above the symphysis pubis**; check for cephalic or breech, usually cephalic; check the position and mobility of the head.
>9. **Palpate the midline downward and just about two inches from the Pourpart's ligaments**; check for position and descent of the head (engagement), including degree of flexion (attitude).
