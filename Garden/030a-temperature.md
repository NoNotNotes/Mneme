# Body Temperature
Body temperature is the balance between **heat generation** and **heat loss**. In general, there are two types of body heat: **core temperature**, measured through contact with mucous membranes or directly from organs or muscles, and **surface temperature**, measured through the skin.

>[!ERROR] Heat Production
>The body's **metabolism** is the primary dictator of heat production. The **basal metabolic rate** itself is the baseline level of metabolism in individuals. Cellular metabolism increases with more **muscle activity** (exercise, shivering, etc.), higher **hormonal function** (T₄, epinephrine, and norepinephrine), and other biological functions such as **inflammation** and **fever**.
>- Age also plays a role in heat production; heat production is generally high in younger ages and gradually decreases as one approaches late adulthood.

>[!ERROR] Heat Loss
>1. **Radiation**: the transfer of heat without direct contact, such as the warmth felt from the sun despite its distance from us.
>2. **Conduction**: the transfer of heat through **contact**.
>3. **Convection**: the transfer of heat through contact through drafts and wind— **air currents**.
>4. **Evaporation**: the loss of heat as moisture evaporates from the surface of the body, which carries heat away from the body. This occurs in breathing, exposed mucosa like the mouth, and importantly, **sweating**.

Multiple factors affect body temperature outside of the body's biological processes. Variance in body temperature may even be explained through these normal conditions:
1. **Age**: infants and children have greater variances in temperature compared to pubertal children and adolescents/adults. As mentioned earlier, metabolic processes continue to slow into adulthood, with those over 75 years old being at risk for hypothermia and hyperthermia. This occurs as a result of both thermoregulatory and physiologic changes.
2. **Diurnal Variations**: temperature undergoes elevations and depressions in line with an individual's **circadian rhythm**. "Diurnal" refers to day time, opposite of "Nocturnal". The body temperature is normally the lowest from 0400 to 0600 hours and rise by up to 1.0°C at the peak, usually around 1600 and 1800 hours (a 12 hour-cycle).
3. **Stress**: stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system can increase metabolic activity and heat production. Stressed and anxious patients are anticipated to have elevated body temperatures.
4. **Environment**: extremes in environmental temperature can affect a client's thermoregulatory systems.
## Thermoregulation
The **hypothalamus** ("*hypothalamic integrator*") maintains the body's optimal temperature by working with sensory receptors throughout the body (peripheral and core). These sensors detect cold and warmth and apply physiologic processes accordingly:
1. When **cold** is detected, (a) **shivering**, rapid contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles, occurs to produce heat from muscle activity, (b) **sweat inhibition** to decrease evaporative heat loss, and (c) **vasoconstriction** to decrease heat loss by distancing the blood from the skin, allowing it to stay "inside".
2. When **warmth** is detected, the opposite occurs; (a) **sweating** increases to enhance evaporative cooling, and (b) **peripheral vasodilation** occurs.

The conscious mind also experiences discomfort with these temperatures and takes steps to thermoregulate, such as through clothing in response to cold or using a fan in response to heat.
## Alterations in Body Temperature
Some declarations: **normal temperature is considered to be between 36°C and 37.5°C (96.8°F to 99.5°F)**. Any temperature higher than this is considered **pyrexia** ("**hyperpyrexia**" if ≥41°C) and any temperature is considered **hypothermia**.

1. **Intermittent Fever**: an intermittent fever is one whose temperature alternates between normal temperature and hyperthermia **within one day**. Common examples of this includes malaria and pulmonary tuberculosis.
2. **Remittent Fever**: a fever that maintains a high temperature with **wide fluctuations** (>2°C) over 24 hours.
3. **Relapsing Fever**: a fever with short periods (**one to two days**) of normal body temperature.
4. **Constant Fever**: a fever that maintains a high temperature with **small fluctuations** in temperature (<2°C) over 24 hours.

5. **Fever Spikes**: temperatures that rapidly become feverish then returns to normal within a few hours, often due to bacterial blood infections.
6. **Heat Exhaustion**: a source of high temperature that is not a "true" fever caused by biological processes; it is a result of environmental exposure. This is accompanied by paleness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fainting, and a moderately increased temperature (38.3°C to 38.9°C \[101°F to 102°F\]). Higher yet (~41.1°C), the individual stops sweating and the skin feels warm and appears flushed. The individual becomes delirious, potentially becomes unconscious, and may experience seizures. This is a **heat stroke**.
7. **Hypothermia**: a result of excessive heat loss, inadequate heat production, and impaired hypothalamic thermoregulation. This may be accidental or **induced** to decrease the oxygen requirement by body tissues such as during certain surgeries. In accidents (exposure to cold environment, immersion in cold water, lack  of adequate clothing or heat source), skin and underlying tissues may be damaged by the freezing cold, resulting in **frostbite**. This commonly occurs in hands, feet, nose, and ears. Patients with hypothermia display decreased body temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, urine output, and level of consciousness progressing down to a coma; severe shivering in early stages; feeling of cold and chills; pale, cool, waxy skin; and lack of muscle coordination.
	- Managing hypothermia involves removing the client from the cold and rewarming the client's body. (a) **Mild Hypothermia** can be managed with blankets, (b) **Severe Hypothermia** should be managed with hypothermia blankets and warm IV fluids. A warm environment, dry clothing and head cover, positioning (limbs close to body), warm oral fluids, and warming pads are all methods for rewarming the patient.

>[!TIP] Frostbite
>1. **First Degree Frostbite**: the skin is intact; it is often only reddened— circulation is intact.
>2. **Second Degree Frostbite**: frost has penetrated into the epidermis.
>3. **Third Degree Frostbite**: frost has penetrated into the subcutaneous tissue.
>4. **Fourth Degree Frostbite**: tissue has become necrotic and blackened.

>[!WARNING] Mercury Thermometer Breakage
>In the event of the breakage of a mercury thermometer, the nurse requires proper disposal protocol to avoid mercury poisoning. The nurse requires (a) **any rubber gloves**, (b) **paper towels** to soak up the mercury, (c) **plastic bags** for disposal sealed with **tape**, and (d) a **flashlight** to scan for beads of mercury. All contaminated materials must be disposed. Disposal via drain and vacuuming and sweeping are dangerous.
>
>Any mercurial thermometers encountered should be promptly recommended for replacement and safe disposal.

>[!TIP] Temperature Scales
>Kozier utilizes three operations to translate between Celsius and Fahrenheit: (a) a constant subtraction or addition of 32, and (b) multiplication by $\frac{9}{5}$ or $\frac{5}{9}$.
>$$
>\text{°C}=(\text{°F}-32)\times\frac{5}{9}
>\\\text{°C}=(100-32)\times\frac{5}{9} = 37.8°\text{C}
>\\\text{ }
>\\\text{°F}=(\text{°C}\times\frac{9}{5})+32
>\\\text{°F}=(40\times\frac{9}{5})+32 = 104°\text{F}
>$$
>
>Personally, I replace $\frac{9}{5}$ or $\frac{5}{9}$ with $1.8$, and instead change between division and multiplication— °C is smaller than °F, so converting from °F to °C uses subtraction then division; °F is larger than °C, so converting from °C to °F uses multiplication then addition. Whichever is easier to remember for you. 🤷‍♂️
>$$
>\text{°C} = (\text{°F}-32)÷1.8
>\\\text{°C} = (\text{100°F}-32)÷1.8=37.8\text{°C}
>\\\text{ }
>\\\text{°F} = (\text{°C}×1.8)+32
>\\\text{°F} = (\text{40°C}×1.8)+32=104\text{°F}

## Temperature Across the Lifespan
1. In **Infants**, temperature is extremely labile due to thermal dysregulation; the hypothalamus is not yet equipped with regulating body temperature.
	- The **axillary site** is preferred; the arm is held against the chest during assessment. The axilla are not as accurate as other routes, but is safe and non-invasive.
	- The **tympanic route** can be used— fast and convenient. The infant is positioned supine and the head is stabilized. The pinna is pulled straight back and slightly downward for children 3 years old and younger, and upward for those older than 3 years old. The probe is directed anteriorly slightly and advanced until the canal is sealed, but not touching the tympanic membrane. This route is avoided with on-going ear infections.
	- The **rectal route** is the least desirable.
2. In **Children**:
	- The **tympanic or temporal artery sites are preferred**. For tympanic route utilization, the same contraindications are in infants is applied. The child is positioned on the adult's lap and the head is held gently against the adult for support. The pinna is pulled straight back and upward for children over age 3.
	- The **oral route** may be used, but only non-breakable, electronic thermometers are recommended.
	- The **rectal route** places the child prone on the parent's lap, or side-lying with the knees flexed. The probe is inserted by 1 inch into the rectum.
3. In **Older Adults**:
	- Temperatures tend to be lower, and easily affected by environmental and internal temperature changes. They are at risk of both hypothermia and hyperthermia. The inability of the older adult body to generate or maintain heat can cause their temperature to fail as a measure of seriousness of the pathology of a disease (e.g., pneumonia may only manifest a slight temperature elevation). Alternative assessments should also be used.
	- **Cerumen impaction** may occur and affect the tympanic route.
	- **Hemorrhoids** are also more common in older adults; assessment is required prior to the use of rectal thermometers.
