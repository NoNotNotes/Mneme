Pharmacology, as review material, is delegated to being an adjunct topic to [[05/index|Medical-Surgical Nursing]]. Most of the medications that will appear on licensure exams are placed within the context of a disease or indication, which is likely going to be discussed on their respective pages. For that reason, this set of notes is low on my priority list. I might focus on the basic principles of pharmacology, but don't expect completion any time soon!

>[!TIP] Ratings?
>**Ratings** are based on a very limited sample size of lecturers (four!) who have rated a topic's **relevance to the board exam** from the options "*Low Priority*" (1), "*Nice to Know*" (3), and "*Must Know*" (5). I'll keep asking around for more input from reviewers!
