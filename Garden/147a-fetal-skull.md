The fetal head has seven bones. Two frontal, two parietal, two temporal, and one occipital. Along the adjacent edges of these bones are **sutures**, and the meeting points of multiple skull bones are fontanels.
1. **Sagittal Suture**: longitudinal, midline
2. **Frontal Suture**: anterior suture between two frontal bones.
3. **Coronal Suture**: anterior suture between frontal and parietal bones.
4. **Lambdoidal Suture**: posterior suture between parietal and occipital bones.
