1. **Thermal Burns**: exposure to high temperatures, the most common form of burning. The most common cause is fire, which requires four elements to appear:
	1. **Heat**: sufficient heat is required for a heat to sustain its chain reaction.
	2. **Oxygen**: oxygen is essential for the chemical reaction of a fire. Oxygen is a flammable gas.
	3. **Fuel**: fuel is continuously consumed in fire
	4. **Chain Reaction**/**Combustion**
2. **Chemical Burns**: exposure to highly acidic or highly alkaline substances.
3. **Electrical Burns**: exposure to electricity, the most lethal form of burning.
4. **Radiation Burns**: exposure to UV or gamma radiation.

Based on the **extent of injury**, burns may be categorized by degree:

| Degree                     | Depth                                 | Manifestations                  | Pain Level         | Wound Healing                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| First Degree (Superficial) | **Epidermis**; Surface-level          | Desquamation (unique)           | Mild to moderate   | 5 to 7 days                   |
| Second Degree              | **Dermis**; Partial Thickness         | Blistering and weeping (unique) | Moderate to Severe | 3 to 4 weeks                  |
| Third Degree               | **Beyond the dermis**; Full Thickness | Charring                        | None               | None; permanent disfigurement |
