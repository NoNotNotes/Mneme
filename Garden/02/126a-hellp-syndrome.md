**HELLP syndrome** is a variation of the gestational hypertensive process named for the common symptoms that occur:
1. **H**emolysis that leads to anemia,
2. **E**levated **L**iver enzymes that lead to epigastric pain, and
3. **L**ow **P**latelets that lead to abnormal bleeding/clotting.

This syndrome occurs in 4% to 12% of patients who have elevated blood pressure during pregnancy. It is a serious syndrome because it results in a maternal mortality rate as high as 24% and an infant mortality rate as high as 35%. Its cause is unknown, although women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in maternal blood are much more likely to develop HELLP syndrome, similar to preeclampsia. It occurs in both primigravidas and multigravidas.

# Signs and Symptoms
In addition to proteinuria, edema, and increased blood pressure:
1. **Liver inflammation**: nausea, epigastric pain, general malaise, and right upper quadrant tenderness.
2. Laboratory studies reveal **hemolysis of red blood cells**, **thrombocytopenia**, and **elevated liver enzyme levels** (ALT, AST), which are all effects of hemorrhage and necrosis of the liver.

>[!ERROR] Complications
>Subcapsular liver hematoma, hyponatremia, renal failure, hypoglycemia from poor liver function, cerebral hemorrhages, aspiration pneumonia, and hypoxic encephalopathy. The fetus may experience growth restriction and preterm birth.

# Therapeutic Management
Therapy for the condition is transfusion of **fresh frozen plasma or platelets** in order to improve the platelet count. Extremely close monitoring for bleeding is required, in addition to the observations necessary for preeclampsia.
1. If **hypoglycemia** is present, this is corrected by an intravenous glucose infusion.
2. The infant is born as soon as feasible by either vaginal or cesarean birth. However, be alert for **maternal hemorrhage** due to thrombocytopenia. Epidural anesthesia may not be possible because of the high possibility of bleeding at the epidural site.
3. The HELLP syndrome will disappear soon after birth, the same as preeclamptic symptoms, but the experience of developing the HELLP syndrome is frightening. Women need assurance afterward that symptoms were pregnancy-related and so will not return.
