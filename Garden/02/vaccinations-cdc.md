___

1. **Hepatitis B Vaccine**: Hepatitis B is an infectious and potentially serious disease that can cause liver damage and liver cancer. There is no cure for hepatitis B. Mothers can unknowingly pass the hepatitis B virus to their babies at birth, which is why babies should get their first dose within 24 hours of birth.
	- **Doses**: 3 — at birth, 1–2 months, 6–18 months
	- The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all adults, age 19 through 59 years.
2. **Hepatitis A Vaccine**: Hepatitis A can be a serious, even fatal liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. Children with the virus often don't have symptoms, but they often pass the disease to others, including their unvaccinated parents or caregivers.
	- **Doses**: 2 — 12–23 months
3. **Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine**: RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants, young children, and adults aged 60+. Those infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating, and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. An RSV immunization uses monoclonal antibodies to protect infants and young children from severe RSV disease. This immunization gives your baby's body extra help to fight an RSV infection.
	- **Doses**: 1 — at birth, all adults ≥75
	- The mother can also receive an RSV vaccine during the 32-36th week of pregnancy. Infants whose mothers did not receive RSV vaccine during pregnancy and children at increased risk for severe RSV are given RSV antibodies.
	- Adults aged 60 through 74 years at increased risk of severe RSV and all adults aged 75 years or older should get a single dose of RSV vaccine.
4. **DTaP vaccine**: A DTaP vaccine is the best protection from three serious diseases: **diphtheria**, **tetanus**, and whooping cough (**pertussis**). All three of these diseases can be deadly for people of any age, and *whooping cough* is especially dangerous for babies.
	- **Doses**: 5 — 1–2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12–23 months, 4–6 years
5. **Tdap Vaccine**: A Tdap booster shot protects older children from three serious diseases—diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis). While people of any age in the United States can get all three of these potentially deadly diseases, whooping cough is most common. Preteens and teens who get whooping cough may cough for 10 weeks or more, possibly leading to rib fractures from severe coughing.
	- **Doses**: 1
	- Every adult should get the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine once if they did not receive it as an adolescent to protect against pertussis (whooping cough), and then a Td (tetanus, diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years.
	- In addition, women should get the Tdap vaccine each time they are pregnant, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks.
6. **Hib Vaccine**: Hib disease is a serious illness caused by the bacteria *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib). Babies and children younger than 5 years old are most at risk for Hib disease. It can cause lifelong disability and be deadly.
	- **Doses**: 3 or 4 (depending on brand) — 1–2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12–23 months
7. **Inactivated Polio Vaccine** (IPV): Polio is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by poliovirus, which can infect the spinal cord and cause paralysis. It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old. Polio was eliminated in the United States with vaccination, and continued use of polio vaccine has kept this country polio-free.
	- **Doses**: 4 — 1–2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12–23 months
8. **Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine** (PCV): Pneumococcal disease can cause potentially serious and even deadly infections. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protects against the bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease.
	- **Doses**: 4 — 1–2 months, 4 months, 6–18 months, 4–6 years
	- CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all adults who never received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and are age 50 years or older.
9. **Rotavirus Vaccine**: Rotavirus can be very dangerous, even deadly for babies and young children.
	- **Doses**: 2 or 3 (depending on brand) — 1–2 months, 4 months, 6 months
10. **COVID-19 Vaccine**: CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older.
	- People ages 65 years and older should receive 2 doses of any 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, spaced 6 months apart.
11. **Flu Vaccination**: starting from 6 months, all persons should receive flu vaccination every flu season. Flu vaccine is especially important for people with chronic health conditions and pregnant women.
12. **Chickenpox Vaccine**: Chickenpox is a very contagious disease known for its itchy, blister-like rash and a fever. Chickenpox is a mild disease for many, but can be serious, even life-threatening, especially in babies, teenagers, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.
	- **Doses**: 2 — 12–23 months, 4–6 years
	- Adults who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses. The doses should be at least 28 days apart.
13. **MMR Vaccine**: The MMR vaccine helps prevent three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). These diseases are contagious and can be serious.
	- **Doses**: 2 — 12–23 months, 4–6 years
	- Adults who do not have presumptive evidence of immunity should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine. Students at post-high school educational institutions who do not have presumptive evidence of immunity need two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days.
14. **HPV Vaccine**: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that can cause several cancers in men and women. HPV vaccination is recommended at ages 11-12 years to help protect against cancers caused by HPV infection.
	- **Doses**: 2 — 11–12 years, interval of 6-12 months
	- If you were not vaccinated at a younger age (HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years), then you should also get an HPV vaccine.
15. **MenACWY Vaccine**: Meningococcal disease can refer to any illness caused by a type of bacteria called *Neisseria meningitidis.* These bacteria can cause meningococcal meningitis or bloodstream infections, which can be serious, even deadly. The meningococcal vaccine called MenACWY helps protect against four types of the bacteria that causes meningococcal disease (serogroups A, C, W, and Y).
	- **Doses**: 2 — 11–12 years, 13–18 years
16. **MenB Vaccine**: Meningococcal disease can refer to any illness caused by a type of bacteria called *Neisseria meningitidis.* These bacteria can cause meningococcal meningitis and bloodstream infections, which can be serious, even deadly. Meningococcal B vaccine, or MenB vaccine, helps protect against one type of the bacteria that causes meningococcal disease (serogroup B).
	- **Doses**: 2
	- CDC does not routinely recommend MenB vaccine for all adolescents. Instead, healthcare providers and parents can discuss the risk of the disease and weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination.
17. **MenABCWY Vaccine**: Meningococcal disease can refer to any illness caused by a type of bacteria called *Neisseria meningitidis.* These bacteria can cause meningococcal meningitis and bloodstream infections, which can be serious, even deadly. Pentavalent meningococcal vaccine, or MenABCWY vaccine, helps protect against five types of the bacteria that causes meningococcal disease (serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y).
	- **Doses**: 1
	- MenABCWY vaccine can be given instead of MenACWY and MenB vaccines when both of those vaccines are being given at the same visit. MenABCWY is **not given in addition** to those two vaccines.
18. **Shingles Vaccine**: Adults 50 years and older get two doses of the shingles vaccine to prevent shingles and complications from the disease.
