# Diagnostic Criteria
"**FEEL My Conjunctivitis**"
- **Fever** for at least five days, often high fever
- **Edema** of the hands and feet from compromised venous return. Often, this results in a classic presentation of "a child who refuses to walk".
- **Erythematous Rash**— polymorphic; nonspecific. It can look like any kind of rash, but it is often diffuse, maculopapular, and erythematous. One unique manifestation that can point towards Kawasaki is **desquamation**.
- **Lymphadenopathy** can be found in at least one node that's ≥1.5 cm, most often in the cervical region.
- **Mucositis** appears as dry, cracked, swollen lips; red throat and oral mucosa; and a **strawberry tongue** which appears bumpy like a strawberry (reminder, the tongue appears white before it becomes red).
- **Conjunctivitis** that is non-purulent (watery), bilateral, and classically with *limbic sparing*.

A diagnosis is made if the fever persists for five or more days and four of the other five criteria are present. Additional findings include sterile pyuria and thrombocytosis (often a late sign).
