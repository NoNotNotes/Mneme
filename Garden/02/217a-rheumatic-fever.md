___

An infection involving the heart, CNS, joints, subcutaneous tissue, and the skin caused by Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus.
- Risk Factors: **children with dental caries** (check-up once every 6 months), those who have had **recent or recurrent strep throat**, immunocompromisation

___

# Jones Criteria
In **Rheumatic Fever**, the child presents with **two major manifestations** or **one major with two minor manifestations**.
1. **Major**: heart carditis, CNS chorea, joint polyarthritis, subcutaneous nodules, skin erythema marginatum.
2. **Minor**: fever, history of strep. infection (ask for sore throat), elevated laboratory findings (anti-streptolysin O titer \[ASOT]), arthralgia
	- **ASOT** Lab Findings:
		- 150 to 250: (inc.)
		- \>250 to <500: Dormant RF
		- \>500 to <5000: Active RF
		- \>5000: Rheumatic Heart Disease
	- **ESR**, increased during hyperemia.
	- **CRP**, produced by the liver in response to inflammation and tissue damage. This is used to determine both the presence of inflammation and **response to treatment**.

___

# Pathophysiology
1. Spread of GABHS to the pulmonary system, through pulmonary circulation, to the **mitral valve** (proliferation) of the heart results in the major manifestations:
	- **Carditis**
	- **CNS Chorea**
	- **Polyarthritis**: inflammation
	- **Subcutaneous Nodules**
	- **Erythematous Marginatum**
2. **Mitral Valve Stenosis**: damage to the mitral valve from GAHBS. Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs for compensation. This backs up to the left atrium and pulmonary circulation, resulting in LSCHF. Crackles and moist coughing occurs from pulmonary edema.
	- Lanoxin (Digitalis) increases heart contraction, while decreasing heart rate. This results in bradycardia. **Do not administer Lanoxin if heart rate is less than (adult) 100 (infant), 90 (toddler, 80 (preschooler), 70 (school-age), 60 bpm (adolescent/adult)**. Decreased cerebral perfusion alters LOC.

___

# Nursing Management
1. **Fever**, **Pain** (polyarthritis), **Inflammation**, **Thrombotic Formation**
	- **Aspirin** fulfills all of these problems within a child (antipyretic, analgesic, antiinflammatory effect, thrombolytic effect). The main purpose is for its antiinflammatory effect on polyarthritis.
2. **Diet**: high calorie, high fiber, low sodium, and soft diet. If polyarthritis affects the temporomandibular joint, NGT/OF may be required.
3. **Polyarthritis**: pain may be produced even by thin linens. A **bed cradle is created and formed as a tent**, to maintain thermoregulation without placing weight on the patient directly.
	- Fractured TSB may be required to reduce discomfort. Avoid the joints, and only pat the patient. Place a moist towel on the forehead, torso, and axillary areas.

>[!TIP] PARAFI
>The **PARAFI** mnemonic denotes the interventions for a child with rheumatic fever:
>1. **Pain Control**
>2. **Antibiotics** for an active infection by GABHS
>3. **Rest**
>4. **Aspirin** as an antiinflammatory and as an antithrombotic
>5. **Follow-up Care** is necessary to detect progression or complication of the disease.
>6. **Infection**, specifically **respiratory infection** is prevented and immediately managed to prevent flareups of rheumatic fever.

___

# Treatment
**Penicillin** is the drug of choice, combined with erythromycin and benzathine penicillin.
2. **Oral**: Erythromycin with Penicillin
3. **Monthly injection of 1 gram benzathine penicillin** (twice a month, 500 mg per dose).
