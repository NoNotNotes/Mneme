# Estimated Date of Delivery/Confinement
1. **Naegele's Rule** (EDC, EDD): add seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), and subtract three months, and one year.
	- Ex: $04/10/2023 + -03/07/0001 = 01/17/2024$
2. **Mittendorf's Rule** (EDC, EDD): a method that takes into account the woman's race and gravidity:
	- **Caucasian and G1**: $\text{EDC/EDD} = (\text{LMP} + 15 \text{ days}) - 3 \text{ months}$
	- **Non-Caucasian and G>1**: $\text{EDC/EDD}=(\text{LMP}+10\text{ days})-3\text{ months}$
3. **Date of Quickening ($Q$)**: taking into account quickening only,
	- **Primigravida**: $Q+4\text{ months and }20\text{ days}=\text{EDC/EDD}$
	- **Multigravida**: $Q+5\text{ months and }4\text{ days}=\text{EDC/EDD}$
4. **Fundal Height** (FH): using fundal height (measured from the top of the symphysis pubis to the palpable fundus) estimate EDC/EDD. Prior to examination, the mother needs to **void**.
	- FH at **Symphysis Pubis**: 12 weeks (3 months)
	- FH at **Umbilicus**: 20 to 22 weeks (5 months)
	- FH at **Xiphoid Process**: 36 weeks (early 9th month)

# Age of Gestation
1. **LMP**/**Gestational Age**/**Menstrual Age**: calculation of the duration since the last menstrual period. **Ovulatory age** or **fertilization age** is calculated from the time of ovulation or fertilization. These are two weeks shorter. LMP dating has a 95% prediction interval of ±4.65 weeks (Lee et al., 2020). Mothers may also be unsure of their last menstrual period.
2. **Ultrasound**: a better (Self et al., 2022) determination of gestational age; cerebellar measurement appears to be the most accurate. The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend first-trimester sonography as the most accurate method to establish or reaffirm gestational age.
3. **McDonald's Rule**: determination of AOG based on fundal height (FH) used in the second and third trimesters. Measure the distance from the **top** of the symphysis pubis over the curve of the abdomen to the top of the uterine fundus using a tape measure.
	- AOG in lunar weeks: $\text{FH in cm}\times8/7$
	- AOG in lunar months: $\text{FH in cm}\times2/7$
4. **Bartholomew's Rule of Fours**: estimates gestational age based on fundic height. Prior to examination, the mother needs to **void**.
	- FH at **Symphysis Pubis**: 3 months
	- FH between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus: 4 months
	- FH at **Umbilicus**: 5 months
	- FH just above umbilicus: 6 months
	- FH between the umbilicus and xiphoid process: 7 months
	- FH just below the xiphoid process: 8 months, or late 9th month due to lightening.
	- FH at **Xiphoid Process**: early 9th month
5. **Gestational Age Calculator** (Michalowska & Smialek, 2023): assessing gestational age by estimated due date (EDD).
	- $\text{LMP}=\text{EDD}-280\text{ days}$
	- $\text{Current Date}-\text{LMP}=\text{GA}$
6. **Ultrasonography**: measurement of the biparietal diameter. A biparietal diameter of 9.5 cm is found in a mature fetus, often obtained at the 36th week.
7. **X-ray**: done only at the 16th week onwards; the distal femoral ossification is present at 36 weeks, and proximotibial ossification is present at maturation.
8. **Date of Quickening**: felt at the 20th week.
9. **Identification of FHT**: at 12 weeks by Doppler.

# Fetal Dimensions
1. **Estimated Fetal Weight** (EFW):
	- **Johnson's Rule**: utilizes fundal height to estimate fetal weight, and varies based on **engagement**.
		- $\text{EFW in grams}=(\text{FH}-11)\times155$ if not engaged
		- $\text{EFW in grams}=(\text{FH}-12)\times155$ if engaged
2. **Estimated Fetal Length** (EFL):
	- **Haase's Rule**: utilizes gestational age to estimate the fetal length in centimeters.
		- First five months of the pregnancy: $\text{AOG in months}^2$
		- Second half of the pregnancy: $\text{AOG in months}\times5$
