An abruptio placenta is **a complication of late pregnancy or labor characterized by premature partial or complete separation of a normally implanted placenta**; also termed as accidental hemorrhage and ablatio placenta. This is the **second leading cause of bleeding in the third trimester**; occurring in 1:300 pregnancies second only to placenta previa. Risk factors for abruptio placenta include:
1. **Maternal hypertension**; **PIH** (#1), renal disease
2. **Sudden uterine decompression** such as in polyhydramnios and multiple gestation.
3. **Advanced age**
4. **Multiparity**
5. **Short umbilical cord**: double cord-coil
6. **Trauma** (#2); **fibrin defects**
7. Inappropriate use of **oxytocin**
8. **Infection**

| **Type I**   | Classic **concealed**, **covert**, **central** type. The placenta separates at the center (schultz), causing blood to accumulate **behind the placenta**, *hiding* the presence of bleeding. External bleeding does not appear to match the severity of shock. |
| **Type II**  | **Marginal**, **overt**, **external bleeding** type. The placenta separates at the margins (duncan), allowing old blood (dark red, brown) to spill out. In this type, external bleeding matches the severity of shock.                                         |
| **Type III** | **Mixed**. Some part of the blood remains concealed, while some are expelled.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Assessment Findings and Diagnosis
1. **Painful vaginal bleeding** in the third trimester.
2. **Rigid, board-like, and painful abdomen**.
3. **Enlarged uterus** from concealed bleeding; signs of shock that may be disproportional to external bleeding.
4. **Tetanic contractions** if in laborâ€” alternating contraction and relaxation does not occur.

**Diagnosis** is based on **clinical signs and symptoms** and an **ultrasound** to image **retroplacental bleeding**.

**Clotting studies** reveal the presence of **DIC** and **clotting defects**. The thromboplastin from the retroplacental clot enters maternal circulation and consumes maternal free fibrinogen, resulting in **DIC** and **hypofibrinogemia**.

>[!TIP] Management for both Placenta Previa and Abruptio Placenta
>- **No Internal Examination**; external fetal monitoring
>- Watchful Waiting
>- **Cesarean Section**. AP may result in fetal distress faster than PP.
>- **Coomb's Testing**
