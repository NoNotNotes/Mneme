AKA **Gestational Trophoblastic Disease** (GTD). An **H-mole** is a **benign neoplasm of the chorion**. The chorion fails to develop into a full-term placenta and instead degenerates into **fluid-filled vesicles**. Its actual cause is unknown, but risk factors include:
- **Faulty fertilization**, one of each sex cells are required e.g. two sperms fertilize one egg
- **Low socio-economic standing**
- **Protein deficiency**: the building blocks of tissues; poor protein content results in the death of the blastocele, which, if not removed, will multiply and create fluid filled vesicles rapidly.
- The vesicles rupture from the **16th to 20th week** of pregnancy. The resulting discharge is foul and brown.

# Classical Signs
1. **Bigger-than-date uterus** due to rapid proliferation of blastocele
2. **HCG is abnormally high**: 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 IU/L/24 hours. Its normal value is 50,000 to 400,000 IU/L/24 hours.
3. **Absence of fetal signs**: outline (via ultrasound), heart rate, movement
4. **Passage of vesicles**: confirmatory for H. mole

# Management
If no spontaneous evacuation occurs, the **best** option for management is a **D&C** done with a curette then ovum forceps followed by **suction curettage** via large-bore catheter with low-force suctioning. A hysterectomy may also be done if no future pregnancies are desired, or if hCG remains elevated.
- Afterwards, hCG titer is done to see if remnants were left. If remnants are present, hCG remains high.
- Pregnancy should be avoided for **at least one year** to prevent another H. Mole pregnancy, as this may also result in **choriocarcinoma** (also treated with methotrexate).

>[!ERROR] Prognosis, Complications
>80% of patients experience remission after D&C of the H-mole. However, the chorion may become **cancerous**; a **choriocarcinoma**. This is the most dreaded complication. Other complications includes:
>1. **Hemorrhage**: most serious during the early treatment phase
>2. **Uterine perforation**
>3. **Infection**
