# Oxygen Saturation
A **pulse oximeter** is a noninvasive device that estimates a client's blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) by means of a sensor attached to the client's finger, toe, nose, earlobe, or forehead (or around the hand or foot of a neonate). The oxygen saturation value is the percent of all hemoglobin binding sites that are occupied by oxygen. The pulse oximeter can detect hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation) before clinical signs and symptoms develop.

>[!TIP] Normal oxygen saturation is 95% to 100%; below 90% should be evaluated and treated, and below 70% is life-threatening.

The following are some constraints or factors that affect the viability of an oxygen saturation reading.
1. **Hemoglobin**: saturation is not related to the *amount* of red blood cells actually present. A patient with low hemoglobin can still obtain a normal reading of 100% SpO₂ despite compromised oxygen capacity.
2. **Circulation**: oximeters rely on circulation to an area to obtain readings. An area with impaired circulation is not a viable site for pulse oximetry. This includes transient causes such as vasoconstriction from cold temperatures or long-standing disease processes such as peripheral vascular diseases.
3. **Activity**: shivering or excessive movements of the sensor site may interfere with accurate readings.
4. **Light Interference**: sensors often use light as the medium of measurement. Readings may be altered by exposure to light such as sunlight or a bilirubin light.
5. **Carbon monoxide poisoning**: pulse oximeters cannot tell the difference between hemoglobin bound with oxygen and hemoglobin bound with carbon monoxide.
## Pulse Oximetry Across the Lifespan
1. **Infants**: an earlobe or forehead sensor may be required if fingers, feet, and toes are not available.
2. **Children**: anxiety may be present. Inform the child that the sensor will not hurt. The probe may be disconnected whenever possible to allow for movement of the child.
3. **Older Adults**: vasoconstrictive medications, poor circulation, or thickened nails may interfere with readings. A forehead or earlobe sensory may be used if indicated.
