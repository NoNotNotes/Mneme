**DI** is a rare disorder that occurs due to injury to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland with a deficiency of ADH (vasopressin) that results in excretion of large volumes of dilute urine and extreme thirst. DI is characterized as central, nephrogenic, or dipsogenic, as well as gestational.
>[!ERROR] Etiology
>- The primary etiology for Central DI is **head trauma** but other causes include surgery, infection, inflammation, brain tumors, or cerebral vascular disease. It may also be idiopathic.
>- Nephrogenic DI etiologies include kidney injury, medications (lithium), hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia. This results in a failure of the renal tubules to respond to ADH.
>- Dipsogenic (causes thirst) DI is caused by a defect in the hypothalamus and may be the result of damage to the pituitary gland from a head injury, surgery, infection, inflammatory process, or a tumor.
>
>The onset of diabetes insipidus in adults may either be insidious or abrupt.

# Clinical Manifestations
**ADH** acts on the distal nephron of the kidney to reabsorb water. Without its action, **an enormous daily output** (>250 mL/hour) of **very dilute urine** with a specific gravity of 1.001 to 1.005 occurs.
1. **Polyuria**: >250 mL/hour
2. **Very dilute urine**. Specific gravity of the urine reaches 1.001 to 1.005 
3. **No abnormal urine substances**. There is no glucose or albumin in normal cases.
4. **Extreme thirst**. Those with DI can consume from 2 to 20 liters of fluid daily, craving cold water. Withholding fluids will not reduce urine output, and is not a viable method of controlling the disease.
___
# Assessment and Diagnosis
1. **Fluid Deprivation Test**: withhold fluids from the patient for 8 to 12 hours, or until 3% to 5% of body weight is lost. In patients with diabetes insipidus, the **urine's specific gravity fails to increase even with depleting body fluids**.
	- The test is terminated immediately if tachycardia, excessive weight loss, or hypotension develops.
2. **Plasma Studies**: levels of ADH in the plasma, urine osmolality, and a trial of desmopressin therapy and intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline is done as further diagnostic measures.

>[!TIP] If diagnosis is confirmed but the cause is unknown, **the patient is assessed for tumors** that may be causing the disorder.

___
# Management
1. **Medical**:
	- **Replace ADH** and identify and correct the underlying pathology.
	- **Ensure adequate fluid replacement**.
2. **Pharmacologic**:
	- **Desmopressin** (oral, intranasal) is used for central DI.
	- **Chlorpropamide** (sulfonylurea; oral hypoglycemic agent), and **Thiazide diuretics** are able to potentiate the effects of ADH/vasopressin on the kidneys. They are used in mild forms of DI to enhance fluid retention despite diuretic properties. Watch out for hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance.

 >[!WARNING] If DI is nephrogenic, previous treatments are ineffective.
 >Thiazide diuretics, mild salt depletion, and prostaglandin inhibitors (e.g., endomethacin, aspirin) are used to treat the nephrogenic form of DI.
3. **Nursing**:
	- **Continuous physical assessment**: monitor for clinical manifestations of dehydration
	- **Patient education**: prevention of complications, emergency measures e.g. signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, and medication use and administration.
