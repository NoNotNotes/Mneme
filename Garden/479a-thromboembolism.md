Thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, phlebothrombosis, and deep vein thrombosis are caused by **Virchow's Triad**: Venous Stasis, Hypercoagulability, and Endothelial Lesions. Thrombophlebitis involves a clot involved with inflammation. If a clot occurs without inflammation, it is a phlebothrombosis.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: Non-specific. Edema and swelling, tenderness, redness, and warmth.
- **Diagnostics**: Doppler ultrasonography, duplex ultrasonography, air plethysmography, contrast phlebography (venography)
- **Medical Management**: prevent the thrombus from growing and fragmenting, resolving current thrombi, and prevent recurrence
- **Pharmacologic Therapy**: Heparin, Coumadin, Thrombolytics, and for prophylaxis, Fondaparinux SC
- **Nursing Interventions**: monitor anticoagulant therapy (PT, PTT), monitor complications
