# Fetal Lie
The **relationship of the long axis of the fetus to the long axis of the mother's uterus/spine**.
1. **Longitudinal**: the fetal and maternal axes are parallel. This can be further classified as cephalic or breech presentation depending on which part enters the pelvis first.
2. **Transverse Lie**: the long axis of the fetus is perpendicular to the mother's spine; shoulders present.
___
# Fetal Attitude
The **relationship of the fetal parts to the trunk or to one another**.
1. **Flexion**: the desired attitude.
2. **Extension**
___
# Fetal Presentation
The **lowermost part in the pelvic inlet**; the part felt upon internal examination.
1. **Cephalic**: the head is the presenting part.
	- **Vertex**: head acutely flexed
	- **Sinciput**: head moderately flexed
	- **Brow**: head moderately extended
	- **Face**: head acutely extended
2. **Breech**: the buttocks are the presenting part. FHT is felt at the upper quadrants or above the level of the umbilicus, and with the findings of Leopold's maneuvers 1 (hard, round, ballottable mass) and 3 (soft, globular, non-ballottable mass).
	- **Complete** (Full): feet and legs are flexed on the thighs; buttocks and feet presenting; fetus squatting; the type favoring most the second stage of labor as the feet could be used as traction.
	- **Incomplete** (Frank): thighs flexed against the abdomen; legs extending up to the shoulders as they lie on the anterior chest; buttocks present; the type favoring most the first stage of labor as the large buttocks are a good dilating wedge.
	- **Footling** (single or double): one foot or two present; the type is easily complicated by **cord prolapse**.
>[!TIP] Meconium Staining
>If the fetus is breeched, **the passage of meconium staining is not a sign of fetal distress**.

3. **Shoulders**: usually referred to as a transverse lie; the fetal long axis lies perpendicular to the maternal spine, and the fetus appears to lie crosswise in the uterus.
___
# Fetal Position
Position refers to the **relationship of the denominator or landmark of the presenting part to the front imaginary quadrants of the mother's pelvis**. Assessment of the position can be done through Leopold's maneuvers, vaginal examination, and rectal examination (obsolete).
1. **Chosen Landmarks/Denominators**:
	- Occiput (O) for vertex presentation
	- Mentum (M) for face presentation
	- Sacrum (S) for breech presentation
	- Acromiodorso (AD) for shoulder presentation
2. **Four Imaginary Quadrants**:
	- Left anterior
	- Right anterior
	- Left posterior
	- Right posterior

|                     | Occiput | Mentum | Sacrum | Acromiosdorso |
| ------------------- | :-----: | :----: | :----: | :-----------: |
| **Left Anterior**   | **LOA** |  LMA   |  LSA   |     LAPA      |
| **Right Anterior**  |   ROA   |  RMA   |  RSA   |     RAPA      |
| **Left Posterior**  | **LOP** |  LMP   |  LSP   |     LAPP      |
| **Right Posterior** | **ROP** |  RMP   |  RSP   |     RAPP      |
- **Left occipitoanterior** (LOA) features the occiput pointing towards the mother's left abdominal wall, face is down towards the maternal right buttocks; most common and favorable position.
- **Occiputposterior** (OP), either left (LOP) or right (ROP), is a factor in **prolonged labor**, with the mother experiencing much discomfort (backache) during labor. Comfort measures: side-lying, backrub, counter-sacral pressure during contractions.
