1. **Abstinence**: primarily countered by self-control.
	- **Strict**: absolute abstinence from any form of intercourse.
	- **Regular**: no vaginal intercourse, permitting other forms of intercourse.
2. **Lactational Amenorrhea Method** (LAM): provides protection for 6 months after delivery when **observing exclusive breastfeeding** via maintenance of high estrogen levels, which inhibits the release of FSHRF, therefore inhibiting FSH, the hormone responsible for maturation of egg cells. (Breastfeeding → High Estrogen → Low FSHRH → Low FSH → Non-maturity of Egg Cells)
	- Breastfeeding may be combined with pills when the 6 month period runs out.
3. **Fertility Awareness Method** (FAM): the **F**ather **a**nd **M**other should both receive counselling for education about family planning.
	- **Calendar Method**:
		- Ask the patient if they are regular or irregular.
		- If **regular**, ask the patient about the duration of their cycle. To get their window of fertility, deduct 14 from the length, then extend three days back and five days forward.
			- 30 day duration → $30 - 16$ → 11th to 19th day after the onset of menstruation.
		- If **irregular**, find the longest cycle and shortest cycle:
			- $\text{LC} - 11$
			- $\text{SH} - 18$
			- The fertile window of the patient is bordered by these values; ex. a **patient with 21 to 36 day cycles would have a fertile window of 3rd to 25th day after onset of menstruation**.
	- **Cervical Mucus Test**/**Billing's Test**/**Spinnbarkeit**/**Creighton's Method**:
		- The cervical mucus is **dry during periods of infertility**, and **wet during periods of fertility**.
		- ex. in a 28 day cycle, the mucus is dry on days 6 to 8, and 18 to 28.
		- The characteristics of a fertile cervical mucus are: **watery, abundant, thin, clear, elastic, and slippery**.
		- Cervical mucus is collected **in the morning, observed after arising from the bed**.
		- Rub the mucus between the thumb and index, then attempt to stretch it. **If it stretches 5 to 10 cm without breaking** (and is therefore thin), the woman is likely fertile.
	- **Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Test**: a woman's BBT increases with high levels of **progesterone**. Temperature is taken before getting out of bed to avoid increasing BBT from activity and eating. Contraindicated in febrile women and those who are unable to obtain a thermometer. In a 28-day cycle with ovulation on the 14th day:
		- 3rd: low estrogen; 13th: high estrogen
		- 13th: low progesterone; a sudden decrease in temperature
		- 14th: high progesterone; a sudden increase in temperature. **Temperature shifts by 0.2C to 0.5C**.
		- ex. d11: 36.7 → d12: 36.7 → d13: 36.5 → d14: 37.0 → d15: 37.0 → d16: 37.0 → d17: decr.
	- **Symptothermal Method**: a combination of CMT and BBT.
	- **2-day Method**: a replacement of the CMT for patients who are against collecting their cervical mucus. For the 2-day method, compare the cervical mucus for the past two days; if two consecutive days are dry (D), the woman is infertile. When a wet (W) period exists within a two day period, the woman may be fertile i.e. DD is okay, DW, and WD, and WW are not.
