**Fetal distress** occurs when a fetus fails to receive adequate oxygen in any condition. It may be caused by many factors, including (in no particular order):
1. Uteroplacental insufficiency
2. Abruptio placenta (placental separation)
3. Placenta previa
4. Fetal ketosis in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
5. Cord compression
6. Tetanic contractions during labor (>90s)
7. Preeclampsia
8. Anemia
9. Oligohydramnios (can also lead to cord compression)
10. Placental degeneration in post-term clients
11. Uterine rupture
12. Abnormal fetal presentation
13. Maternal stress

# Assessment Findings
The following findings may be indicative or confirmatory of fetal distress (also in no particular order).
1. **Fetal Heart Rate**: less than 100 BPM, normally 120 to 160 BPM.
2. **Decelerations**: late or variable deceleration, normally early.
3. **Negative Nonstress Test** is a warning sign. A **Positive Nipple Stimulation Contraction Test** is an ominous sign.
4. **Kick Count**: less than normal in a 10 minute period. Normal activity is 5 to 15 kicks, average of 10 in 1 hour.
5. **Meconium-stained Amniotic Fluid** is an automatic indication of fetal distress for non-breech fetuses. In breech-presented fetuses, alternative methods of determining distress is required as passing meconium during labor is expected from compression of the anal sphincter.
6. **Hyperactivity** followed by **hypoactivity** in later distress.
7. **Tachycardia** followed by **bradycardia** in later distress.
8. **Vaginal Bleeding** is always an ominous sign in pregnancy, except for the expected **show** as a sign of true labor.
9. **Cramping** or other abnormal contractions may place the fetus in distress.
___
# Management
1. **Positioning**: the mother is placed on a left-lateral position
2. **Oxygen therapy** via face mask @ 5 to 8 L/min flow rate.
3. **Stop IV oxytocin** (Syntocinon, Pitocin)
4. **Notify the physician**.
5. Place the patient on **NPO status**â€” they are a possible cesarean section.
