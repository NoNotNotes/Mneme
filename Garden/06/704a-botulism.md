**Botulism** is a common form of food poisoning. Botulinum toxin, produced by the bacterium *Clostridium botulinum*, is among the most potent toxins. It is able to induce lethal effects at concentrations in the nanograms (one-billionth of a gram).
- Its nature is **neurotoxic**, and many variants existâ€”botulinum toxin type A through G. Botulinum toxins type A, B, E, and F are those that affect humans. The end effect of toxicity is nerve damage producing respiratory and muscle paralysis.
- The bacterium *Clostridium botulinum* is commonly found in home-made canned, preserved, or fermented food. The most common form of transmission of the bacterium is through the **ingestion** of contaminated food.
- **Diagnostic Evaluation**: a diagnosis of botulism is made after the observation of the toxin in the serum, stool, or consumed food.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: **descending paralysis**. The specific problem related to this manifestation is **respiratory failure**, appearing 12 to 36 hours after exposure to *C. botulinum*.
- **Management**: botulism antitoxin is highly effective, especially when administered early.
	- In severe cases when respiratory failure appears, **mechanical ventilation** may be required. Supportive therapies are provided as indicated.
- **Preventive Measures**: maintenance of hygiene, especially in food preparation and storage. Raw and cooked food should be separated. Cooking should be done thoroughly.
