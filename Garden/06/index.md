Communicable diseases can be separated into its own category, but is often included in [[03/index|Community Health Nursing]] and some parts of [[05/index|Medical-Surgical Nursing]]. Specifically for the PNLE, communicable diseases are often limited to endemic diseases and other diseases prevalent within the Philippines. It's always been a blind spot of mine, so I haven't made many notes on these, but I'll work on it. Right now the list of topics is missing content on the basic principles of communicable diseasesâ€”those will be added later on.

>[!TIP] What are Ratings?
>**Ratings** are based on a very limited sample size of lecturers (four!) who have rated a topic's **relevance to the board exam** from the options "*Low Priority*" (1), "*Nice to Know*" (3), and "*Must Know*" (5). I'll keep asking around for more input from reviewers!
