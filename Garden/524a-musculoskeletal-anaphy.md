The **musculoskeletal system** serves various functions:
1. provides **protection** for organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs;
2. serves as a **framework** to support body structures;
3. makes **mobility** possible through muscles, tendons, bones, and joints, which also produces heat for maintaining body temperature;
4. **aids in venous return** of deoxygenated blood by massaging the venous vasculature; and
5. is a **reservoir for immature blood cells and essential minerals** including calcium (more than 98% of total body content), phosphorus, magnesium, and fluoride.

# Structure and Function of the Skeletal System
The adult human body contains 206 bones of varying classifications according to shape:
1. **Long**: mainly found in the extremities like the femur, and are shaped like rods or shafts with rounded ends.
	- The "shaft" is known as the **diaphysis** and is primarily composed of **cortical bone**, a compact type of bone tissue.
	- The ends of the bone are called **epiphyses** and are primarily composed of porous and spongy **cancellous** (trabecular) **bone**.
	- In childhood and adolescence, the diaphysis and epiphyses are separated by the **growth plate**, or the **epiphyseal plate**. It is composed of cartilage that nurtures and facilitates longitudinal growth before becoming calcified in adults.
	- The ends of long bones are covered at the joints by **articular cartilage**, a tough, elastic, and avascular tissue.
2. **Short**: smaller bones located in the ankle and hand e.g. the metacarpals.
3. **Flat**: found in **regions essential for protection** e.g. the sternum of the ribcage or the skull.
4. **Irregular**: any bones not categorized under any of the previous three, like the vertebrae or the bones of the jaw.

>[!NOTE] Bone Composition
>The shape and construction of specific bones are determined by its function and the forces exerted on it. Bones may either be constructed from strong cortical bone or the spongy cancellous bone.
>- **Cortical bone exists in areas where support is needed**, such as in the long bones used for weight-bearing and movement.
>- **Cancellous bone exists where hematopoiesis and bone formation occur**. In the flat bones used for protection while also being important sites of hematopoiesis, cancellous bone is layered between compact bone. Short bones are often cancellous bone covered by a layer of cortical bone.
>- Irregular bones are often similar to flat bones in structure.

___
# Bone Composition
Bone is composed of **cells, protein matrix, and mineral deposits**.
- **Osteoblasts** function in bone formation by **secreting bone matrix**. Bone matrix consists of **collagen and ground substances** that provide a **framework in which inorganic materials** (calcium, phosphorus) **are deposited**.
- **Osteocytes** are mature bone cells involved in bone maintenance, and are located in **lacunae**.
- **Osteoclasts**, located in shallow **Hollowship's lacunae** (small pits in bones), are multinuclear cells involved in dissolving (bone matrix is dissolved to maintain the marrow cavity) and resorbing bone.
- **Osteons** are the microscopic functioning units of **mature cortical bone**, or the **haversian system**.
	- In the center of the osteon (the **haversian canal**) is a capillary. Surrounding these are **lamellae**: circles of mineralized bone matrix. **In the lamellae are the lacunae that contain osteocytes**. The osteocytes are nourished through **canaliculi** (canals) that communicate with adjacent blood vessels.
- Within **cancellous bone**, **lacunae are layered in irregular lattice networks** known as **trabeculae**. Red bone marrow fills the lattice network.
	- Red bone marrow is a vascular tissue that covers the medullary cavity of long bones and in flat bones. These are mainly located in the sternum, ilium, vertebrae, and ribs. These produce red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets through the process of **hematopoiesis**. In adults, the long bones are filled with **fatty, yellow marrow**.

The bone is covered by a layer of dense fibrous membrane called the **periosteum**. This contains nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics, and attachments points for tendons and ligaments. The periosteum nourishes the bone. The **endosteum** is a thin, vascular membrane that **covers the marrow cavity of long bones** and the **spaces in cancellous bone**.

___
# Bone Formation
**Osteogenesis** begins before birth. **Ossification** is the process by which bone matrix is formed and hard minerals are bound to collagen fibers. These **mineral components give both its characteristic strength**, while **proteinaceous collagen give bone its resilience**.

___
# Bone Maintenance
Bones are dynamic tissues in a constant state of turnover; old bone is removed and new bone is added (**bone remodeling**).
- In children, bone is formed more than bone is dissolved. Bones become larger, heavier, and denser and peak in size and density by 20 years of life.
- **Complete bone turnover** occurs approximately **every 10 years**.

Multiple factors affect the balance of bone formation and resorption: **physical activity**, **dietary intake of certain nutrients**, and **hormones**:
1. **Physical Activity**: particularly from weight-bearing activities, this stimulates bone formation and remodeling. Bones subjected to weight-bearing tend to be thick and strong; people who are unable to participate in these activities e.g. bed-ridden, disabled, lose bone mass, becoming **osteopenic** and weak, increasing risk for fractures.
2. **Nutritional Intake**: good dietary habits are integral to bone health.
	- **1000 to 1200 mg of Calcium** daily is essential for maintaining adult bone mass. Food sources include **low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, and other milk products**. Some foods also have added calcium e.g. **orange juice, cereals, and bread**.
	- **600 IU of Vitamin D** daily plays a vital role in **calcium absorption** and bone health. Individuals 50 years or older require a higher daily intake of **800 to 1000 IU** to ensure good bone health. Food sources include **vitamin-D fortified milk and cereals**, **egg yolks**, **salt-water fish**, and **liver**. 
3. **Hormones**:
	- **Calcitriol**, the activated form of Vitamin D, functions to increase the amount of calcium absorbed in the GIT. It also facilitates mineralization of osteoid tissue.
		- **Deficiency** results in **bone mineralization deficit**, **deformity**, and **fracture**.
	- **Parathyroid Hormone** and **Calcitonin** are the major hormonal regulators for calcium homeostasis. **PTH mobilizes calcium, promoting demineralization of the bone** and the formation of bone cysts. **Calcitonin reacts to elevated calcium levels, inhibiting resorption and increasing deposition of calcium into bone**.
	- **Thyroid Hormone and Cortisol** have multisystemic effects with specific effects on bones.
		- **Excessive thyroid hormone**, e.g. in Graves' disease, can result in **increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation**.
		- **Increased levels of cortisol** have the same effects. Long-term synthetic cortisol or corticosteroid therapy produce an increased risk for steroid-induced **osteopenia** and fractures.
	- **Growth Hormone** has direct (**stimulates bone growth**) and indirect effects on skeletal growth and remodeling. It **stimulates the liver**, and to a lesser degree, the bones to produce an **Insulinlike Growth Factor 1** (IGF-I) that accelerates bone modeling in children and adolescents.
		- It is believed that low levels of both GH and IGF-I related to aging decreases bone formation and results in **osteopenia**.
	- **Sex Hormones** (Estrogen, Testosterone) are important to bone remodeling.
		- **Estrogen** stimulates osteoblasts (formation) and inhibits osteoclasts (resorption).
		- **Testosterone** has direct and indirect effects on bone growth. It stimulates skeletal growth in adolescence and skeletal muscle growth throughout life. As a result of skeletal muscle growth, bones are subjected to heavier weight-bearing activities, and results in more bone formation.
			- Testosterone converts to **bone-preserving estrogen** in adipose tissue for aging men.

# Bone Healing
Most **fractures** (breaks in bone) heal through a combination of **intermembranous** and **endochondral ossification** processes. When damaged, the bone begins a healing process to reestablish continuity and strength. The bone **regenerates, and does not utilize scar tissue**.
- **Endothelial cells** in the bone marrow rapidly differentiate into **osteoblasts**
- **Osteons** are formed in the **bone cortex**
- **A hard callus** (fibrous tissue) is formed through intramembranous ossification peripheral to the fracture, and is where **cartilage** is formed through **endochondral ossification** adjacent to the fracture and soft tissue, where a **bridging callus** forms, providing stability.

Healing occurs in four stages, similar to injuries in other parts of the body:
1. **Hematoma Formation**: during the first 1 to 2 days. Bleeding into the injured tissue and local vasoconstriction occur. A hematoma forms. **Cytokines** are released, initiating the healing process by **stimulating fibroblasts to proliferate**, causing **angiogenesis**. **Granulation tissue** begins to form in the clot and becomes dense. Simultaneously, degranulated platelets and inflammatory cells release **growth factor**, which stimulate the generation of **osteoclasts** and **osteoblasts**.
2. **Inflammatory Phase**: with the formation of granulation tissue, **fibroblasts** (fibrocartilaginous soft callus bridge connecting bone fragments) and **osteoblasts** (new bone) migrate into the fractured site and begins reconstruction. Girth may be restored within three weeks, but weight-bearing ability is still impaired.
3. **Reparative Phase**: often within three to four weeks, a **firm bony union** is formed. **Mature bone gradually replaces the fibrocartilaginous callus** and the excess callus is reabsorbed by the osteoclasts. The fracture site appears immovable. **Cast removal may be safe if used**. X-rays show **alignment**.
4. **Remodeling**: **necrotic bone is removed** by the osteoclasts. **Compact bone replaces spongy bone around the periphery of the fracture**, resulting in a thickened area on the surface of the bone that may remain after healing. This may take months to years, depending on the extent of modification, function of the bone, and functional stresses. Monitoring is done with serial x-rays to check for progress. Various factors can alter progress, including the type of bone, adequacy of blood supply, condition of fragments, and immobility of the fracture site.
	- If external or internal fixation is used, bone fragments can be placed in direct contact and alignment with each other, minimizing cartilaginous callous formation.
