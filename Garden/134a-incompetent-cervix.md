A condition characterized by a **mechanical defect in the cervix causing cervical effacement, dilation, and expulsion of the products of conception in the mid-trimester of pregnancy**. Pregnant women are at risk for an incompetent cervix if they (a) have a **congenital defect of the cervix** (short cervix), (b) **trauma to the cervix** as in forceful dilatation, curettage, and difficult delivery, and (c) **cervical lacerations procedures** (conization, cauterization).

This appears as:
1. **Painless contractions resulting in the delivery of a dead or non-viable fetus**
2. **History of abortions** (habitual abortion)
3. **Finding of a relaxed cervical os** on pelvic examination

# Treatment and Nursing Management
**Cervical cerclage** during the 14th and 16th week of gestation or prior to the next surgery. **A suture or ribbon is placed beneath the cervical mucosa to close the cervix during pregnancy to help prevent pregnancy loss or premature birth**. This may be done via:
- **Shirodkar-Barter Cerclage**: a permanent suturing of the cervix, with future pregnancies delivered via cesarean section.
- **McDonald Cerclage**: a temporary purse-string suturing of the cervix removed at term in preparation for a vaginal delivery.
