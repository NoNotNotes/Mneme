Inflammation of the visceral and parietal pleurae.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: Pain exacerbated by breathing/positioning and a pleural friction rub.
- **Diagnostics**: auscultation for a friction rub, CXR, sputum cultures, and thoracentesis
- **Medical Management**: monitor for pleural effusion (complication). Main goal is pain and symptomatic relief (NSAIDs, hot and cold therapy, intercostal nerve blocks for severe pain)
- **Nursing Interventions**: splint the affected side of the chest wall to reduce pain; teach patient to split with arms or pillow when coughing.
