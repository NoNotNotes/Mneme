Hemorrhaging may be internal or external. For identification, patients may be checked for **signs and symptoms**:
- **Shock triad** (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea). Hypotension is a result of blood loss, while tachycardia and tachypnea are compensatory mechanisms in order to attempt to maintain perfusion.
- **Discoloration**: pallor occurs from decreased blood volume.
- **Lowered level of consciousness** from decreased cerebral perfusion.
- **Weak thready pulse** from decreased blood volume.

For **first aid**,
1. **Locate the sites of bleeding**. Assess all areas of the body that may be bleeding.
2. **Apply direct pressure**. This is the **gold standard** as the initial action or bleeding. If bleeding persists, **apply pressure on the proximal arteries**.
3. **Place the patient on a modified trendelenburg position** (Shock position). This shifts blood flow from the legs to the vital organs, and the modification used to reduce pressure on the diaphragm. It is a position where the patient lies flat on the bed with the legs elevated.
4. **Monitor for hypovolemic shock**. Transport the patient to the nearest hospital once bleeding has been managed.

>[!ERROR] Epistaxis
>In case of nose bleeding, the principle still applies: **apply direct pressure** on the nose bridge. The patient is positioned upright with the neck flexed, or leaning forward. A **cold compress** can be used for vasoconstriction to reduce bleeding.

# In The Emergency Room
The patient in the hospital will:
1. Receive **Oxygen Therapy**
2. Receive **Fluid Resuscitation/Fluid Volume Replacement** with **IV Fluids**, best with NSS.
3. Receive **Blood Transfusion**. Blood type O is used in emergency cases as the universal donor.
4. **Blood vessel repairs** are performed by surgeons once managed.
