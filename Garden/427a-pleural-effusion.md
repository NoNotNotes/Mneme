Build-up of fluids in the pleural cavity. May be clear, exudative, purulent, or even blood.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: depending on size. May be asymptomatic, may be acute respiratory distress. Dullness or flatness in percussion over the affected area, minimal or absent breath sounds, absent fremitus, and tracheal deviation may be observed.
- **Diagnostics**: physical examination (percussion, auscultation), CXR, CCT, Thoracentesis, Pleural biopsy and fluid analysis
- **Medical Management**: discover the underlying cause, prevent re-accumulation of fluid (thoracentesis, shunting, chemical pleurodesis, pleurectomy), relieve discomfort and pain.
- **Nursing Interventions**: prepare for thoracentesis, monitor drainage and water-seal system, pain relief (medications, positioning, ambulation), education for catheter/tube care for drainage if to be discharged.
