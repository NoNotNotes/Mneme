An aneurysm is the enlargement of an artery caused by weakness of the arterial wall. It is often asymptomatic until a rupture occurs. Most commonly comes in tandem with atherosclerosis.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: usually clinically silent until rupture. Non-ruptured aneurysms may cause obstruction or promote clotting (thromboembolism) which may lead to a stroke or other complications. Thoracic aneurysms may cause dyspnea or dysphagia.
- **Complications**:
	- Severe chest or back pain may indicate aortic aneurysm.
	- Acute severe headache may indicate an SAH.
	- Angina (chest pain) may indicate obstruction of the coronary arteries by an embolus.
	- Any ruptures may cause pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and lightheadedness.
- **Risk Factors** include hypertension, poor diet, sedentary living, and obesity. The most common is smoking (it increases risk of both an aneurysm and a rupture).
- **Nursing Assessment**: anticipate a rupture. Assess for activity of all the organs.
___
# Aortic Aneurysm
The largest artery. Most commonly affected site is the abdominal aorta: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA; Triple A). It is normally 2 cm in diameter, and may dilate up to 5 cm. Past 5.5 cm, surgery is necessary. Uncommonly, a Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA) may occur. It has a higher survival rate but presents the same.
___
# Cerebral Aneurysm
Also known as "berry" aneurysms, as they appear like small berries on branches. Ruptures of these berry aneurysms can cause death within 24 hours; 40% of ruptures being fatal and 66% resulting in permanent neurological damage. These are the most common type of stroke: subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs)
___
# Peripheral Aneurysm
Less likely to rupture, but still occur.
- **Popliteal Aneurysm**: behind the knee. The most common peripheral aneurysm.
- **Splenic Artery Aneurysm**: near the spleen.
- **Mesenteric Artery Aneurysm**: the artery supplying the intestines.
- **Femoral Artery Aneurysm**: the femoral artery by the groin.
- **Carotid Artery Aneurysm**: the major neck artery.
- **Visceral Aneurysm**: arteries that supply the bowel or kidneys.
## Intracranial Aneurysm Care
- **Nursing Assessment**: Complete neurologic assessment, pupillary reaction, motor and sensory function, speech, ocular, etc. Detect subtle changes, especially changes in LOC.
- **Nursing Diagnoses**:
	- Ineffective tissue perfusion (cerebral) related to bleeding or vasospasm.
	- Disturbed sensory perception due to the restriction of aneurysm precautions.
	- Anxiety due to illness or restrictions of aneurysm precautions.
- **Complications**: vasospasm, seizures, hydrocephalus, re-bleeding, hyponatremia.
- **Nursing Interventions**:
	- **Tissue Perfusion**: assess regularly, avoid clotting, avoid increases in intracranial pressure (elevate head, don't strain, no caffeine, etc.)
