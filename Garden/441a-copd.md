- **Clinical Manifestations**: ==chronic cough, sputum production, DOE==, and progressive; weight loss.
- **Medical Management**: smoke cessation, bronchodilators/corticosteroids
- **Nursing Assessment**: determine current symptoms.
- **Nursing Management**:
	- **Achieving Airway Clearance**: Monitor for dyspnea and hypoxemia, pharmacologic therapy, measure expiratory flow rates and volumes; postural drainage, chest physiotherapy
	- **Improving Activity Tolerance**
	- **Improve Breathing Patterns**
	- **Monitor for Complications**'
___
# Emphysema
Abnormal distention of the airspaces â†’ destruction of the walls of the alveoli. Due to its resultant appearance, it is termed as the "**Pink Puffer**" disease.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: barrel chest, severe dyspnea, thin-framed body
- **Diagnostics**: incentive spirometry, CXR, hyperinflation + flattened diaphragm, arterial blood gases (mild-mod hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis)
___
# Chronic Bronchitis
The presence of cough and sputum daily for at least 3 months in at least two consecutive years. Inflammation and sputum production results in increased mucus-secreting cells, and further increases mucus production. Blockage of the airways reduces ciliary function. Due to its resultant appearance, it is termed as the "**Blue Bloater**" disease.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: chronic productive cough, weight gain, elevated hemoglobin (compensatory), wheezing, peripheral edema
- **Diagnostics**: incentive spirometry, arterial blood gases (mild-mod hypoxia, respiratory acidosis), at least 3 months of daily chronic coughing in two consecutive years.
- **Complications**: RSHF, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax
___
# Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis
- **Nursing Management**: low flow oxygen (2-3 L/min) via a Venturi mask; semi-/high-fowler's position; teaching pursed-lip breathing; chest physiotherapy
- **Pharmacologic Management**: bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists, anticholinergics), steroids, methylxanthines
- **Dietary Management**: high calorie, high protein diet
