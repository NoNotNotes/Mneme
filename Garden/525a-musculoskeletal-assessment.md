1. **Health History**: musculoskeletal disorders may be stable or progressive, characterized by symptom-free periods as well as fluctuations in symptoms.
	- Details about **onset**, **character**, **severity**, **location**, **duration**, and **frequency** of S/S.
	- Note its associated complaints: **precipitating**, **aggravating**, and **relieving factors**;
	- **Progression**, **remission**, and **exacerbation**.
	- **Presence or absence of similar symptoms in family members**.
2. **Common Symptoms**:
	- **Pain** and **Tenderness**: bone pain is typically described as a **dull, deep ache** that is "**boring**" in nature. It is not typically related to movement and may interfere with sleep. **Rest** relieves most musculoskeletal pain.
		- **Muscular pain** is described as soreness or aching, potentially referred to as "*muscle cramps*".
		- **Fracture pain** is described as **sharp, piercing**, and **relieved by immobilization**.
		- **Bone infection** (osteomyelitis) may also result in **sharp pain** with muscle spasms or **pressure on a sensory nerve**.
		- **Joint pain** is felt around or in the joint and **typically worsens with movement**.
		- **Pain that increases with activity** indicates **joint sprain**, **muscle strain**, or **compartment syndrome**.
		- **Steadily increasing pain** points to **progressing infection**, a malignant tumor, or neurovascular complications.
		- **Radiating pain** is found in conditions that place pressure on a nerve root.
		- The **time of day in which pain occurs** may also be important: **inflammatory rheumatic disorders** experience worse pain in the morning, especially upon walking. **Tendonitis** worsens during the early morning and eases by midday. **Osteoarthritis** worsens as the day progresses.
		- Some assessment focuses include:
			- Is the body in alignment?
			- Are the joints symmetrical or are bony deformities present?
			- Is there any inflammation or arthritis, swelling, warmth, tenderness, or redness?
			- Is there pressure from traction, bed linens, a cast, or other appliances?
			- Is there tension on the skin at a pin site?
	- **Altered Sensations**: sensory disturbances are frequently associated with musculoskeletal problems. **Paresthesias** may be described as sensations of burning, tingling, or numbness. These may be caused by pressure on **nerves** or **circulatory impairment**. Assess the patient's neurovascular status in the affected area.
		- **Soft tissue swelling** or **direct trauma** to neurovascular structures may impair their function.
		- Some assessment focuses include:
			- Is the patient experiencing abnormal sensations, such as burning, tingling, or numbness?
			- If the abnormal sensation involves an extremity, how does this feeling compare to sensation in the unaffected extremity?
			- When did the condition begin? Is it getting worse?
			- Does the patient also have pain?
3. **Past Health, Social, and Family History**:
	- **Occupation**, **exercise patterns**, **alcohol consumption**, **tobacco use**, and **dietary intake** (Vit. D, Calcium).
	- **Concurrent health conditions**: diabetes, heart disease, COPD, infection, preexisting disability
	- **Related problems** (familial or genetic abnormalities)
	- Any **history of trauma, or injuries** (e.g. falls)
4. **Fracture Risk Assessment Tool** (FRAX): a tool to predict a patient's 10-year risk for fractures of the hip or other major bones (spine, forearm, shoulder). The data required includes **age**, gender, **BMI**, history, **parental history of hip fractures**, cigarette use, **corticosteroid use**, **history of RA**, alcohol intake of 3 or more drinks per day, and **history of secondary causes/risks for osteoporosis**. **Bone Mineral Density** (BMD) based on bone densitometry results may be used as risk assessment if hip-based.
5. **Assess for osteoporosis** if the patient is a postmenopausal woman over the age of 50, has low BMD, and those with secondary causes/risks for osteoporosis.

# Physical Assessment
1. **Posture**: the normal curvature of the spine is **convex through the thoracic portion and concave through the cervical and lumbar portions**. Common deformities of the spine include:
	- **Kyphosis**: rounding of the back from increased forward curvature of the thoracic spine; hunchback. This may occur at any age from **degenerative diseases of the spine** (e.g. arthritis, disc degeneration, fractures r/t osteoporosis, and injury or trauma) or other **neurovascular diseases**.
	- **Lordosis**: exaggerated curvature of the lumbar spine. This may occur at any age. Common causes include **tight low back muscles**, **excessive visceral fat**, and **pregnancy**.
	- **Scoliosis**: lateral curving deviation of the spine. This may be congenital, idiopathic, or from damage to paraspinal muscles (e.g. muscular dystrophy).
	- During inspection, the spine, back, buttocks, and legs are exposed. Standing and trunk symmetry are noted from posterior and lateral views. Differences in the **height of the shoulders or iliac crests** are noted. Shoulder and hip symmetry, as well as the line of the vertebral column, is inspected twice with the patient erect, then while bending forward.
		- **Scoliosis is evidenced by an abnormal lateral curve in the spine**, **shoulders are not level**, the **waistline is asymmetric**, and a **prominent scapula** (especially noticeable when bent forward).
		- Inspection should also be done with the patient bending backwards with support from the nurse.
2. **Gait**: assess gait by having the patient **walk away from the examiner for a short distance**. Observe the gait for **smoothness** and **rhythm**. Any **unsteadiness or irregular movements** (frequently noted in older adult patients) are considered abnormal.
	- A **limping motion** is most frequently caused by **painful weight bearing**. In such instances, the patient can usually pinpoint the area of discomfort, thus guiding further examination.
	- A limp may be observed **if one extremity is shorter than another**, with the **hip dropping downward on the affected side** with each step.
	- In a normal gait, **the knee should flex**: limited joint motion may interrupt the smooth pattern of gait.
	- Other **neurologic conditions** are also associated with abnormal gaits, such as spastic hemiparesis gait (from a stroke), steppage gait (from lower motor neuron disease), and a shuffling gait (found in Parkinson's Disease).
3. **Bone Integrity**: assess for **deformities and alignment**. Compare symmetries between parts of the body such as extremities. Abnormal bony growths due to tumors may be observed.
	- **Shortened extremities**, **amputations**, and **abnormal alignment** are noted.
	- **Fracture** findings may include **abnormal angulation of long bones**, **motion found at points other than joints**, and **crepitus** (grating/crackling sensation or sound) at the point of abnormal motion.
	- The nurse should assess the following:
		- If the affected part is an extremity, how does its overall appearance compare to the unaffected extremity?
		- Can the patient move the affect part? If an extremity is involved, does each toe or finger have normal sensation and motion, and is the skin warm or cool?
		- What is the color of the part distal to the affected area? Is it pale? Dusky? Mottled? Cyanotic?
		- Does rapid capillary refill occur? (The nurse can gently squeeze a nail until it blanches, then release the pressure. The amount of time for the color under the nail to return to normal is noted. Color normally returns within 3 seconds. The return of color is evidence of capillary refill.)
		- Is a pulse distal to the affected area palpable? If the affected area is an extremity, how does the pulse compare to the pulse of the unaffected extremity?
		- Is edema present?
		- Is any constrictive device or clothing causing nerve or vascular compression?
		- Does elevating the affected part or modifying its position affect the symptoms?
4. **Joint Function**: note the **range of motion, deformity, stability, tenderness, and nodular formation**.
	- **ROM** is evaluated actively and passively. The nurse should be familiar with the normal ROM of major joints. Precise measurements may be made using a **goniometer**.
	- Limitations may exist from **skeletal deformity**, **joint pathology**, or **contractures** (shortening of surrounding joint structures) of the muscle, tendons, or joint capsules.
	- If compromised, the joint is examined for **effusion** (suspected if swollen and normal bony landmarks are obscured), **swelling**, and **increased temperature** that may reflect active inflammation.
	- **Patellar Joint Effusion** may manifest as **knee ballottement** or the **balloon sign**. Consultation with a specialist is indicated.
	- **Joint Deformity** may be caused by **contractures**, **dislocation**, **subluxation**, or **disruption of structures surrounding the joint**.
	- **Weakness may indicate the need for an external supporting appliance**.
	- **Palpation** during **passive movement** provides information about **integrity**: motion is normally smooth. Snapping or cracking may indicate ligament slippage. Crepitus indicates a disorder that produces rough deformity of the articular surfaces.
	- **Nodules** may form, such as the characteristic nodules of **rheumatoid arthritis**, **gout**, and **osteoarthritis**
		- **Rheumatoid Arthritis** has characteristic **soft subcutaneous nodules on the extensor tendons** for the joint.
		- **Gout nodules** are **hard and lie within and immediately adjacent to the joint** capsule itself.
		- **Osteoarthritic nodules** are **hard and painless**, and represent bony overgrowth resulting from destruction of the cartilaginous surface of bone within the joint capsule.
5. **Muscle Strength and Size**: note muscular strength and coordination, size, and ability to change positions. **Weakness** can indicate a variety of conditions, such as polyneuropathy, electrolyte imbalances (particularly of potassium and calcium), myasthenia gravis, poliomyelitis, and muscular dystrophy.
	- Have the patient **perform certain maneuvers with and without added resistance** from the nurse. A simple handshake can provide an indication of grasp strength.
	- **Clonus** (rhythmic contractions) of the ankle or wrist may be elicited by sudden, forceful, sustained dorsiflexion of the foot or extension of the wrist.
	- **Fasciculation** (involuntary muscle twitching) may be observed.
	- **Measure extremity girth** (the maximum circumference) compared to the unaffected extremity to monitor for increases in size from rehabilitation, edema, or bleeding; or decreases in size from atrophy. **Note location or landmark of measurement for consistency**.
6. **Skin**: inspect the skin for edema, temperature, and color. Palpation of the skin may reveal warmer areas that suggest increased perfusion or inflammation, or cooler areas that suggest decreased perfusion, and wether edema is present.
	- **Cuts**, **bruises**, **skin color**, and **evidence of decreased circulation** or **inflammation** can influence nursing management of musculoskeletal disorders.
7. **Neurovascular Status**: obtained frequently in musculoskeletal disorders, especially for fractures because of the risk of tissue and nerve damage.
	- The nurse should be aware of the **symptoms of compartment syndrome**, a result of increased pressure in a muscle compartment, resulting in **nerve and muscle anoxia and necrosis**. Function can be **permanently** lost if uncorrected for 6 hours.
