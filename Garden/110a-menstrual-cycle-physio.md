**Menstruation** is a series of rhythmic reproductive cycle that begins **from the onset of menstrual bleeding to the day before the next bleeding day**. It is characterized by changes in the ovaries and the uterus, influenced by normal hormonal variation mediated by the **hypothalamus** and **anterior pituitary gland** (APG) via a negative feedback mechanism. This cycle functions to **prepare for the release of egg, fertilization, and implantation**.
- Begins recurring cyclically at puberty with the first menstruation called **menarche** and ceasing at **menopause**.
- The duration of the cycle is highly individualized, but the average/mean cycle length is 28 days; as short as 21 days or as long as 40 days. The regularity of the cycle is also individualized, as some experience irregular (fluctuating length) cycles.
- The only fairly constant interval is the time from **ovulation to the beginning of menses**, which is almost always **14 to 15 days**.

# Hormonal Control of the Menstrual Cycle
1. **Hypothalamic Hormones**: the hypothalamus secretes gonadotrophin-releasing (GnRF/GnRH) or inhibiting factors (GnIF) that stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete or inhibit the secretion of corresponding gonadotrophins (Gn).
2. **Anterior Pituitary Hormones** (APG): the producer of gonadotrophins (Gn), follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH).
	- **FSH** is secreted in response to the hypothalamic follicle-stimulating hormone releasing factor (FSHRF) triggered by **low blood levels of estrogen during the first half of the menstrual cycle**. Estrogen, by the **fourth to fifth day**, is at its lowest in a regular 28-day cycle.
	- **LH**, also called interstitial-cell stimulating hormone, is secreted in response to the hypothalamic luteinizing hormone releasing factor (LHRF) triggered by **low blood levels of progesterone**. Progesterone, by the **thirteenth day**, is at its lowest. **Progesterone is responsible for the rise in basal body temperature** found on the **fourteenth day**, and the **drop on the thirteenth day** in a regular 28-day cycle.
3. **Ovarian Hormones**: **Estrogen** and **Progesterone**
	- **Estrogen** is secreted by the **ovaries**, adrenal cortex, and placenta (during pregnancy).
		- It is **responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics**
		- Assists in the **maturation of ovarian follicles**
		- **Inhibits** secretion of **FSH** (negative feedback)
		- **Stimulates** secretion of **LH** (positive feedback)
		- It is **responsible for the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle**.
		- It is **responsible for the fertile cervical mucus** that is conducive to fertilization; the change of cervical mucus to thin, clear, colorless, stringy, stretchable, slippery, and lubricative, returning a positive ferning test.
		- In pregnancy, it **increases vascularization**, maintains the **highly-specialized endometrium (decidua)**, stimulates **uterine muscle contraction**, causes **fatigue**, and **antagonizes insulin**.
	- **Progesterone** is secreted by the **corpus luteum** (non-pregnant/early pregnancy) and **placenta** (as early as the sixth week of pregnancy until parturition)
		- **Inhibits** secretion of **LH** (negative feedback)
		- Helps **maintain the endometrium by facilitating the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle** in preparation for **nidation** (implantation)
		- **Relaxes smooth muscles, including the myometrial muscle of the uterus**:
			- Maintains pregnancy by **maintaining decidua**. If progesterone levels drops in pregnancy, abortion (early pregnancy) or premature labor (late pregnancy) may occur.
			- One of the main *theories of labor onset* is when progesterone levels drop at term, giving way for the myometrium to contract easily from stimulation by rising stimulants such as oxytocin and prostaglandin.
		- **Increases body temperature** (Thermogenic)
		- **Water-retaining, anti-diuretic action**; **decreases hemoglobin and hematocrit levels**
		- **Increases fibrinogen level, increasing coagulability**
		- **Responsible for infertile cervical mucus**: thick, opaque, sticky, non-stretchable
		- **Antagonizes insulin** along with estrogen, human placental lactogen (HPL), and cortisol.
4. **Prostaglandin**: fatty acids recognized as a hormone secreted by a lot of body organs, including the endometrium of the uterus. This affects the menstrual cycle and contributes to stimulating uterine muscles for contraction

# Menopause
Menopause is a transitional phase for women marking **the end of their reproductive abilities**. Menopause is to the climacteric as menarche is to puberty. It occurs between **45 to 50 years in 50% of women; can be from 35 to 60 years with an average of 53 years**; not completed until 2 years since the last period.
- **Ovulation ceases two years prior to menopause** with some individual variation.
- Initially, **menstruation becomes irregular**, then it **ceases altogether**.
- The drop in estrogen attributed to menopause causes physical symptoms:
	- Hot flashes: a cluster of symptoms due to vasomotor disturbances related to hormonal changes and cessation of menses. It is characterized by a **heat arising in the chest and spreading to the neck and face** (caused by vasodilation), sweating, occasional chills, dizzy spells, palpitations, and weakness.
	- Emotional changes, such as mood swings or emotional lability.
	- Sleep disturbances
	- The tendency to obesity is not because of a change in adipose deposits but rather due to increased caloric intake.
	- Sexual drive may not be diminished; it may even improve as the need for contraception disappears.
	- Atrophic changes in the vagina, vulva, and urethra and in the trigonal area of the bladder, which may result in dyspareunia, but can be overcome with lubricating gel, or saliva, the most common vaginal lubricant.
	- The breasts become pendulous and decrease in size and firmness.
	- Long-range physical changes may include osteoporosis associated with low estrogen and androgen levels, lack of physical exercise, and low dietary intake of calcium.
- **Treatment**, if necessary, include:
	- **Estrogen replacement therapy** if there is no history of cancer in the family (this treatment is controversial. Short-term low-dose estrogenic therapy may be used for troublesome vasomotor disturbances (hot flashes). Sustained high-dose estrogen therapy has been reported to predispose women to reproductive tract cancer. Hormonal vaginal creams/lubricants (K-Y jelly) for painful coitus or dyspareunia
	- **Vitamin B complex and E** for hot flashes and other symptoms
	- **Increased calcium and phosphorus intake** for **osteoporosis intervention**
	- **Support system to provide emotional support**.
