### First Aid
1. **Extinguish the fire**, if the patient is still actively on fire. Alternatively, "logrolling" the patient can be used to extinguish the patient.
2. If the patient has been extinguished, **open the airway**.
3. **Cool water may be applied over the burns**, but not ice. No other substances must be used, even burn ointments.
4. **Remove clothing over burns**.
5. **Cover the wound with wet dressing** (wet to avoid adhesion).
6. **Transport** the patient.
### In The Hospital
1. **Establish airway**. This is always a priority.
2. **Administer oxygen**.
3. **Start fluid replacement**. The fluid of choice is **Plain Lactate Ringer's Solution**. This is used to stimulate the body with lactic acid in order to stimulate the body to produce bicarbonate for correction of metabolic acidosis.
4. **Antibiotics are given as prophylaxis**. The drug of choice is **Mafenide Acetate** (**Sulfamylon**), a topical antibiotic.
5. **Administer narcotic analgesics for pain**. The drug of choice is **Morphine sulfate**.
6. **Administer tetanus prophylaxis**.
7. **NGT Insertion** may be used to remove gastric acids to avoid the occurrence of **Curling's ulcer**.
8. **Refer the patient for skin grafting**.
