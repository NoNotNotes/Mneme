The **pulse** is a wave of blood created by contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. Generally, the pulse wave represents the stroke volume output or the amount of blood that enters the arteries with each ventricular contraction. The following are some terms related to pulse:
1. **Compliance**: the ability of arteries to distend (stretch) when pressure is applied by a heart beat, and rebound when the pressure is released.
2. **Cardiac Output**: the amount of blood sent through the body in one minute. This is equal to the stroke volume multiplied by the heart rate. In a resting adult, the heart pumps about 5 liters of blood each minute.
3. **Stroke Volume**: the amount of blood sent through the body with each contraction of the heart.
4. **Peripheral Pulses**: pulses located away from the heart e.g. the foot or wrist.
5. **Apical** (Central) **Pulse**: the pulse obtained from the apex of the heart, referred to as the **point of maximal impulse** (PMI)
6. **Heart Rate**: the amount of contractions performed by the heart in one minute.

>[!TIP] Factors Affecting the Pulse
>- **Age**: similar to temperature, pulse decreases as age increases.
>- **Sex**: after puberty, the male pulse rate becomes slightly lower than the female pulse rate.
>- **Exercise**: the pulse rate increases with activity depending on cardiac size, strength and efficiency; athletes will experience a slower rate of increase during exercise than the average individual.
>- **Fever**: an elevated body temperature causes vasodilation, which lowers blood pressure, which causes an increased heart rate. A fever also increases metabolic rate, which also contributes to an accelerated pulse.
>- **Medications**: medications that have chronotropic, inotropic, or domotropic effects can increase or decrease pulse rate, strength, and conductivity respectively.
>- **Hypovolemia or Dehydration**: loss of fluid from the vascular system increases the pulse rate as the heart attempts to increase blood pressure.
>- **Stress**: sympathetic nervous stimulation increases the overall activity of the heart in both rate and force. Causes of stress include fear, anxiety, and acute pain.
>- **Position**: dependent positioning (sitting or standing) decreases venous blood return and subsequent reduction in blood pressure, increasing the heart rate.
>- **Pathology**: certain diseases such as heart conditions or those that impair oxygenation can alter the resting pulse rate.

# Pulse Sites
1. **Temporal**, where the temporal artery passes over the temporal bone of the head. It is above and to the side (superior and lateral) of the eye.
2. **Carotid**, at the side of the neck where the carotid artery between the trachea and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
3. **Apical**, at the apex of the heart. In an adult, this is located on the left side of the chest about 8 cm (3 in.) to the left of the sternum (breastbone) at the **fifth intercostal space**. This may be further left in cardiomegaly. The location of the apical pulse also changes during childhood, illustrated below.
4. **Brachial**, at the inner aspect of the biceps muscle of the arm or medially in the antecubital space.
5. **Radial**, where the radial artery runs along the radial bone, on the thumb side of the inner aspect of the wrist.
6. **Femoral**, where the femoral artery passes alongside the inguinal ligament.
7. **Popliteal**, where the popliteal artery passes behind the knee.
8. **Posterior tibial**, on the medial surface of the ankle where the posterior tibial artery passes behind the medial malleolus.
9. **Dorsalis pedis**, where the dorsalis pedis artery passes over the bones of the foot, on an imaginary line drawn from the middle of the ankle to the space between the big and second toes.

# Assessing the Pulse
A pulse is commonly asses through palpation or auscultation.
1. **Palpation**: middle three fingers placed on the pulse site; used for all sites except the apex of the heart. The fingers of the hand should apply moderate pressure; too light and a pulse may not be palpated, while too firm and the pulse may be obliterated.
2. **Auscultation**: a stethoscope is used for assessing apical pulses. In difficult-to-assess pulses (usable in noisy environments), a **doppler ultrasound stethoscope** may be used.

>[!WARNING] Be Aware
>The nurse should be aware of the following:
>1. Any medication that could affect the heart rate.
>2. Whether the client has been physically active. If so, wait 10 to 15 minutes until the client has rested and the pulse has slowed to its usual rate.
>3. Any baseline data about the normal heart rate for the client. For example, a physically fit athlete may have a resting heart rate below 60 beats/min.
>4. Whether the client should assume a particular position (e.g., sitting). In some clients, the rate changes with the position because of changes in blood flow volume and autonomic nervous system activity.

The pulse can be assessed according to **rate**, **rhythm**, **volume**, **arterial wall elasticity**, and **presence or absence of bilateral equality**.
1. **Rate**: **>100 beats/min** is considered **tachycardia** and **<60 beats/min** is considered **bradycardia**. In either case, if this is observed, the nurse must obtain the apical pulse.
2. **Rhythm**: the pattern and intervals of the beats. In a normal pulse, beats are spaced in equal time intervals. A pulse with an irregular rhythm is referred to as a **dysrhythmia** or **arrhythmia**. These appear as random, irregular beats or a predictable pattern of irregular beats ("*regularly irregular*"). The apical pulse should be assessed if any abnormality is observed, and an ECG is necessary to define the dysrhythmia further.
3. **Pulse Volume**: "strength" or "amplitude". The force of the blood with each beat, ranging from **absent** to **bounding**. Absent pulses are weak and easily obliterated even without moderate pressure, while bounding pulses are strong and difficult to obliterate.

| Grade | Pulse Characteristic                  |
| :---: | ------------------------------------- |
|   0   | Absent; non-palpable pulses           |
|   1   | Weak, thready pulses                  |
|   2   | Normal; easily distinguishable pulses |
|   3   | Strong pulses; bounding               |

4. **Arterial Wall Elasticity**: upon palpation, healthy, normal arteries feel straight, smooth, soft, and pliable. The loss of elasticity often appear as a tortuous (twisted) and irregular artery upon palpation.
5. **Bilateral Equality**: checking for perfusion to a peripheral pulse should also warrant the assessment of the corresponding pulse on the other side of the body. The second assessment gives the nurse data with which to compare the pulses. In assessing perfusion, the nurse starts at the most distal pulse site (e.g., dorsalis pedis) and makes their way up the extremity until a pulse is found.

>[!TIP] Patient-Centered Care
>Clients can be provided guidance in relation to pulse assessment at home.
>1. Teach the client to monitor the pulse prior to taking medications that affect the heart rate. The client should know to report any notable changes in heart rate or rhythm.
>2. Inform the client about activities known to significantly affect pulse rate such as emotional stress, exercise, ingesting caffeine, and sleep. If clients are sensitive to pulse rate changes, they should consider the modification of these activities to stabilize the pulse.
>3. Lengthy monitoring may use a Holter monitor, an ambulatory recorder usable for 24 hours or longer. Other cardiac event monitors also exist, such as those activated during periods of exacerbation.

>[!WARNING] Pulse Deficit
>A pulse deficit is a difference between apical and peripheral pulses. This warrants an apical-radial pulse assessment.

# Pulse Across the Lifespan
- **Newborns** may have physiologic (expected) heart murmurs. These reflect functional incomplete closure of fetal heart structures (ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale).
- **Infants**: apical pulse is used up to 2 to 3 years old to establish baseline data, normalcy, and regularity of the rhythm. The infant is placed supine while the infant is comfortable and rested; this necessitates apical pulse assessment ahead of other uncomfortable procedures to avoid artificial elevation of pulse findings.
- **Children**: the child is placed in the adult's arms or close to the adult. This may decrease anxiety and yield more accurate results. In apical pulses, children are placed supine or sitting like adults. Prior to assessment, play-based demonstration (with a stuffed animal or doll) may be done along with allowing the child to handle the stethoscope before beginning the procedure. This promotes cooperation and decreases anxiety.
- **Older Adults**: severe hand or arm tremors may make radial pulse assessment difficult. Peripheral pulses become less reliable in old age due to decreased cardiac output, sclerotic changes, and dysrhythmias. An apical pulse is increasingly more preferred over peripheral pulses. Contrastingly, this weakness of the peripheral pulse warrants assessment of pedal pulses for regularity, volume, and symmetry. This age group also takes a longer period to return to their baseline values after activity.
