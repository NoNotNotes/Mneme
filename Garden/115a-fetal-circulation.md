There are two external and three internal parts of fetal circulation that allows the fetus to oxygenate in-utero. These are the **placenta**, **umbilical cord**, **ductus arteriosus**, **ductus venosus**, and **foramen ovale**.
1. **Oxygenated blood from the placenta** is sent through the **umbilical vein** through the **ductus venosus** and directly into the **inferior vena cava**. This bypasses the normal adult circulation through the liver. A minute amount of blood is still passed through the liver for nourishment. The **inferior vena cava** (oxygenated) and **superior vena cava** (deoxygenated) deposit blood into the **right atrium**.
	- Blood coming in from the **inferior vena cava** will mostly pass through the **foramen ovale** into the **left atrium**, as it closes the superior vena cava and tricuspid valve. From the left atrium, blood is pumped to the **left ventricle** and through the **aorta**, which nourishes the brain.
	- Blood coming in from the **superior vena cava** will mostly pass through the **tricuspid valve** into the **right ventricle**, through the **pulmonary artery**, through the **ductus arteriosus**, and **to the descending aorta**.
2. **Deoxygenated blood** is sent back to the placenta through the **umbilical arteries** from two arteries past the bifurcation of the descending aorta.
3. The **ductus** ("ducts"; temporary connections between two vessels) shunts blood in fetal circulation. There are **three shunts** in a fetus:
	1. **Ductus venosus**: connects the umbilical vein and inferior vena cava, bypassing the immature liver.
	2. **Ductus arteriosus**: connects the pulmonary artery and aorta, allowing blood to shunt from right-to-left.
	3. **Foramen ovale**: connects the two atria, allowing blood to shunt left-to-right, bypassing the lungs.
4. **After clamping and cutting and at delivery**, fetal circulation begins to adapt and become alike to adult circulation.
	- The **umbilical vessels** (arteries and vein) will **shrink and close**.
	- The baby's **lungs expand**, which begin to receive more blood. This blood returns to the left atrium of the heart, increasing left-side pressure (and decreasing right-side pressure), and **closing the flap of the foramen ovale**. This occurs within 12 hours.
	- Decreasing **prostaglandin** will also result in the **closure of the ductus arteriosus** as **oxygen concentration increases, constricting the duct**. This occurs within 24 hours.
	- The **longest waiting time is 48 hours** for the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus to close before pathology is suspected. In assessment, **these manifest as murmurs**.

>[!TIP] Tip
>Memorize the normal pathway of blood through the body and the heart. Visualization of how blood moves across each chamber and major vessel in each defect is very important in understanding the nature of the congenital heart defects:
>1. IVC, SVC, and Coronary Vessels deposit blood into the Right Atrium
>2. Right Atrium, Tricuspid Valve, Right Ventricle
>3. Right Ventricle, Pulmonary Valve, Pulmonary Artery, Lungs
>4. Lungs, Pulmonary Veins, Left Atrium
>5. Left Atrium, Mitral/Bicuspid Valve, Left Ventricle
>6. Left Ventricle, Aortic Valve, Aorta
