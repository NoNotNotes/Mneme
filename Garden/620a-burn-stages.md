1. **Emergent Stage** (Fluid Accumulation Stage; first 24-48 hours): the shifting of fluid from the intravascular space to the interstitial spaces.
	- This is the cause of **hypovolemia**, tachycardia, and weak pulses.
	- Fluid also includes sodium, which means **hyponatremia** occurs.
	- In cellular injury, the intracellular potassium leaks out, which produces **hyperkalemia**.
2. **Acute Stage** (Fluid Remobilization Stage; **Diuretic Stage**; 3 to 4 days): the shifting of fluid back from the interstitial spaces to the intravascular space.
	- This presents a problem when the shifted fluid has been replaced, and its return will result in **hypervolemia**.
	- **Urine output will increase**, giving this stage its alternate name.
	- Diuresis also involves the excretion of potassium, which **results in hypokalemia**.
	- Sodium levels become **unstable**. Both hyper- and hyponatremia can occur.
3. **Recovery Stage** (5 days+): normalization of the patient's status.
