1. **Premenstrual Syndrome**
	- activity with rest (aerobic exercises), relaxation techniques, stress management, pharmacotherapy as prescribed (SSRIs, Progesterone Supplementation) 
2. **Amenorrhea**: the absence of menstruation; **primary** if menarche never occurred, and **secondary** if menses ceased for more than 3 months after a regular cycle has been established. **Pregnancy is the most frequent cause of secondary amenorrhea**. It may also be related to stress, malnutrition, obesity, and hormonal imbalance (ovarian, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal)
	- Causes of primary amenorrhea include thyroid gland abnormalities (typically hyperthyroidism; first suspect even without other S/S), or other endocrine dysfunctions or problems of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterus; chronic illnesses associated with malnutrition or tissue hypooxygenation.
3. **Dysmenorrhea**: in Greek, literally "*painful monthly bleeding*". It usually corresponds to the secretory phase of the endometrium indicating that ovulation has occurred; absent when ovulation is suppressed.
	- **Primary**: pain not associated with other diseases or pathology; treat with rest, heat application, distraction, exercise, hormonal therapy, NSAIDs, and analgesia, especially prostaglandin inhibitors (Ibuprofen) as Prostaglandin F is the main contributor in this disorder. It may also be caused by acute uterine anteflexion, retroflexion, and cervical stenosis.
	- **Secondary**: pain associated with a malpositioned uterus, PID, IUD, endometriosis, or endometritis 
4. **Metrorrhagia**: abnormal bleeding between menses/period or intercyclic bleeding. May be related to PID, uterine fibroids, corpus carcinoma, erosion, and cancer of the cervix.
5. **Monometrorrhagia**: excessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding that may lead to or cause hypovolemia and anemia.
6. **Menorrhagia**: excessive, profuse menstrual flow; may be caused by hormonal imbalance, infection, or uterine tumors.
7. **Oligomenorrhea**: infrequent menses.
8. **Polymenorrhea**: too frequent menses.
9. **Hypomenorrhea**: abnormally short menstrual cycle.
10. **Hypermenorrhea**: abnormally long menstrual cycle.
## Nursing Implementation
**Promptly refer for evaluation and diagnosis** if there is excessive menstrual flow, intermenstrual or post-menopausal bleeding, absence of menarche at age 17, and severe pre-menstrual tension syndrome. **Promote relief of discomfort from dysmenorrhea** through rest, mild sedatives, leg lifts, external heat to the lower abdomen, hot drinks, and treatment as ordered (antiemetics, prostaglandin inhibitors)
