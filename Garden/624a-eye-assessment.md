# Ocular History
Questioning elicits necessary information for the diagnosis of an ophthalmic condition. Pertinent questions to ask when taking an ocular history include:
- What does the patient perceive to be the problem?
- Is **[[#visual acuity]]** diminished?
- Is the patient experiencing **blurred**, **double**, or **distorted** vision?
- Is there **pain**? Is it sharp or dull? Does blinking make it worse?
- Is the discomfort an **itching sensation** or more of a **foreign-body sensation**?
- Are both eyes affected?
- Is there a **history of discharge**? If so, inquire about the **color**, **consistency**, and **odor**.
- What is the **duration** of the problem?
- Is this a **recurrence** of a previous condition?
- How has the patient **self-treated**?
- What makes the symptoms **improve or worsen**?
- Are there any **systemic diseases**? What **medications** are used in this treatment?
- What **other eye conditions** does the patient have?
- Is there a **history of eye surgery**?
- Have **other family members** had the same symptoms or condition? **Genetics** may play a role in the causation and progression of eye and vision disorders.

# Visual Acuity
Following health history, a patient's **visual acuity** is assessed. This is a measure against which all therapeutic outcomes are based. It is tested for **near** (14 inches via a **Rosenbaum pocket screener**) and **distance** (20 feet via a **Snellen chart**) vision, performed separately for both eyes. Tumbling/Illiterate E Tests, Number Tests, or Picture Charts are used for illiterate patients or those who use other writing systems.
1. **Snellen Chart**: a series of progressively smaller rows of letters. The patient is asked to read the lowest (smallest) line possible. Each line has its standardized score, with the smallest line being 20/20. The standard of vision (20/20) reflects normal vision, and indicates "*able to see 20 feet away what a normal person can see 20 feet away*". As such, a reading of 20/100 would indicate that the patient is able to see only 20 feet away what a normal person can see 100 feet away.
2. **Counting Fingers** (CF) **Test**: if the largest letter is unreadable, the nurse stands five feet from the person and holds up a random number of fingers, which the patient should state. If they are unable to, move one foot closer to the patient until they are able to. The result is recorded as CF/5, which indicates "*can count fingers 5 feet away*".
3. **Hand Motion Test**: if the patient is unable to count fingers, hand motions are used; moving the examiner's hand up, down, or side-to-side, then asking the patient what direction the hand is moving in. This level of vision is known as **hand motion**.
4. **Light Perception**: patients may only be able to see light, described as "**having light perception**". If they are unable to perceive light, they have no light perception.

# External Eye Examination
The nurse uses a systematic approach to perform an external eye examination. **Assess for symmetry and placement of eyelids, pupils, and muscles**. CNs III, IV, and VI (oculomotor, trochlear, abducens) control movement and pupil size.
1. The **eyelids** should rest just above and below the corneal limbus without exposure of the sclera.
2. Check for **ptosis** (drooping of the eyelid), **ectropion** (turning out of the lower eyelid), or **entropion** (turning in of the lower eyelid). Entropion may involve **trichiasis** (turning in of the eyelashes).
3. **Eyelids and lashes** should be free of **drainage and scaling**.
4. The room should be darkened so that the pupils can be examined. The **pupillary response is checked with a penlight** to determine if the pupils are equally reactive and regular. **Pupils are normally black**. Pupils may become abnormal due to trauma, previous surgery, or a disease process.
5. Eyes are **observed in primary or direct gaze**, and **any head tilt is noted**. A head tilt may indicate **CN palsy**.
6. Have the patient stare at a target; **each eye is covered and uncovered quickly** while the examiner **looks for any shift in gaze**.
7. **Nystagmus** is noted when present.
8. **Extraocular movements** are tested by having the patient follow the examiner's finger, pencil, or a hand light through the **six cardinal directions of gaze**: up, down, right, left, and both diagonals.
