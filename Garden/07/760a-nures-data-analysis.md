# Research Variables
Variables are any characteristic or attribute of a person or an object which may be affected by an experience, events, or phenomenon being studied. It changes or "*varies*", but basically can be measured either quantitatively or qualitatively. They may be classified as:
1. **Independent Variables**: the "*cause of the study*"; the variable that is manipulated in an experimental research and greatly influences the dependent variable.
2. **Dependent Variables**: the "*effect or response of the study*"; the variable that is being influenced by the independent variable.
3. **Extraneous/Confounding/Intervening Variables**: variables that may affect the study, but the researcher does not choose to control.

Variables may be expressed or related in various forms:
1. **Proposition**: an assertion of the relationship between concepts.
2. **Construct**: a set of concepts which can be subjected to empirical testing.
3. **Model**: a symbolic representation of phenomena. It symbolizes some aspects of reality, concrete or abstract, by means of likeness which may be structural, diagrammatic, pictorial, or mathematical (Bush, 1979).
4. **Assumption**: assertions which are held to be true but has **not been scientifically tested or proven**. It is often merely based on common sense or basic reasoning.
