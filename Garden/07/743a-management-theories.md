# Theories in Management
- **Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management Theory**: management work can be **scientifically done** to be able to increase work production or output. It may be summarized as follows:
	- Selection of workers
	- Training of selected workers
	- Provision of adequate tools for workers
	- Proper treatment or evaluation
- **Human Relations Theory**: effective management arises from **good working relationships** between the manager and laborers, and among the laborers themselves.
- **Douglas McGregor's Motivational Theory**: a manager may have two classes of workers:
	- **Theory X**: a "*negative*" type of worker that **dislikes work and avoids responsibilities**. They require duress to perform obligations. A high level of motivation is required for them to work.
	- **Theory Y**: a "*positive*" type of worker that are **reliable and gives importance to their job for the best results**. These workers are responsible, diligent, and trustworthy. They productively utilize time, energy, and efforts.
- **Henry Fayol's Principles of Management**: fourteen principles of management are outlined.
	- **Division of Work**:
	- **Proper Authority, Responsibility, and Accountability**:
	- **Unity of Command**:
	- **Unity of Direction**:
	- **Remuneration of Personnel**:
	- **Balance between Centralization and Decentralization**:
	- **Subordination of Personal Interest with General Interest**:
	- **Scalar Chain/Chain of Command**:
	- **Security of Tenure**:
	- **Esprit de Corps; Team Spirit**:
	- **Span of Control**:
	- **Channels of Communication**:
	- **Respondeat Superior; Command Responsibility**:

# Management Styles
William Blake's **Managerial Grid** is a graph to allow for managers to determine their management style. The two axes of the graph denote **concern for productivity** (horizontal) and **concern for people** (vertical). It is divided into four quadrants, named according to their styles:
1. **Impoverished Management**: A low concern for both productivity and people. It is the most ineffective in meeting people's needs and generating positive results for the organization. Disharmony and conflict arise.
2. **Country Club Management**: A low concern for productivity, but high concern for people. They trust people to manage themselves, so they may not provide adequate direction and coaching. Productivity may suffer, but they believe happy people will work hard and generate good results for the company.
3. **Authority-Compliance/Produce-or-Perish Management**: A high concern for productivity, but low concern for people. Impressive results may be reached using strict rules and punitive measures, but these adversely affect team morale and motivation, eventually resulting in a decline in quality and timeliness of desired results.
4. **Middle-of-the-Road Management**: A moderate concern for both productivity and people. A lack of prioritization for either aspect may result in ineffectivity.
5. **Team Management**: A high concern for both productivity and people. A positive work environment where people feel respected, seen, and heard is created. The workers are motivated and inspired to give their best effort, and productivity improves. Absenteeism and turnover is also reduced in this management style.
