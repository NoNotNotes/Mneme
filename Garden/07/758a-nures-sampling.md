- A **population** is a general group to be studied. A **sample** refers to a selected portion of the population from whom the data will be collected. An **element** is an individual member of the sample population. The **sampling frame** is the listing of all elements.

Samples may be chosen in various ways to improve its representation of the population:
1. **Simple Random Sampling**: every element of the population is given an equal chance or opportunity to be chosen as a sample. No bias.
2. **Stratified Random Sampling**: done by first dividing the population into sub-strata or sub-populations according to some subject character (e.g. age), then applying random sampling from each sub-strata or sub-population.
3. **Systematic Random Sampling**: involves utilizing some method to choose from the population randomly, most commonly selecting every nth element from the population.
4. **Cluster Random Sampling**: sampling by sub-areas of the population, applicable if a population is spread geographically.
5. **Accidental/Convenience Sampling**: a non-probability sampling technique that involves choosing samples from readily available groups accessible to the researcher.
6. **Purposive/Judgmental Sampling**: a non-probability sampling technique that involves choosing elements based on common knowledge or as a typical choice.
7. **Snowball Sampling**: a non-probability sampling technique where the researchers use networking or referrals from previous elements to acquire more data, e.g. referrals of one cancer patient to a fellow cancer patient who underwent the same treatment.
8. **Quota Sampling**: a non-probability sampling technique where the population is divided into subpopulations, and chosen based on "other" personal criteria instead of random sampling.
