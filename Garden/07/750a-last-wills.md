1. **Notarial/Ordinary Will**: it is a type of will which the testator must sign using his usual signature at the end as well as in every page thereof. If he cannot sign fully, he may place a usual mark or may ask assistance from another to write his name in his presence and express direction, provided, that the whole act be witnessed by three or more credible witnesses who shall also sign in each and every page of the will except at the end part.
2. **Holographic Will**: the will must only be entirely written, signed, and dated using the hands of the testator. In this case, no witness is necessary. However, the interested party must present any witness who has knowledge of the actual handwriting and signature of the testator and can fully testify that they are of the testator's during probate of the will.
