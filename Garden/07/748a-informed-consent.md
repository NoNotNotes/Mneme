A consent is an agreement between parties that creates an obligation for participating bodies. In healthcare, an example is a contract outlining **services** being provided by the institution to the patient in exchange for the patient's **financial compensation**. In a standard contract, three basic elements are required: (a) the **object**, the subject of the contractâ€” treatment, admission, etc., (b) the **considerations**, the reason for producing a contract, and (c) the **consent** of the patient itself.

An **informed** consent, therefore, is a consent only provided once the patient has **full knowledge** of the possible benefits, risks, alternatives, costs, and other pertinent information as provided by the physician or individual performing treatment in a way that the individual understands. The provision of an informed consent must be **voluntary** (of the individual's own will) and must be **personal** (of the individual's own act i.e. handwriting/signature/thumb mark).

The **validity of consent** can be summarized with the following criteria (mn. VOTUM):
- **Voluntary**
- **Opportunity to ask questions**: the patient must not have any uncertainties.
- **Treatment or surgery must be explained**: full disclosure of the procedures must be given.
- **Understood by patients**: patients must be given an explanation in line with their level of understanding and their language.
- **Matured both Physically** (18+) **and Mentally** (Unaltered LOC)
