# Professional Adjustment, Leadership and Management, Ethics, and Research

>[!WARNING] Content within this domain may only be applicable to the Philippines!

**PALMER** is arguably the most important nursing concept for the board exam. Historically, it's made up anywhere **between 20% to 40% of the PNLE's contents** (100 to 200 items) or even more. It's a set of simple topics, but many are often overlooked. The set of topics I have at the moment can still be expanded, but I'm having a hard time finding reliable references for board-sensitive topics. At the moment, my notes on research are lackluster. Notes are mainly based on Atty. Glenn R. Luansing's reviewer outline.

>[!TIP] Ratings?
>**Ratings** are based on a very limited sample size of lecturers (four!) who have rated a topic's **relevance to the board exam** from the options "*Low Priority*" (1), "*Nice to Know*" (3), and "*Must Know*" (5). I'll keep asking around for more input from reviewers!
