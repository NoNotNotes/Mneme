1. **Barrier**: prevents the sperm from entering into different parts of the reproductive system. The condoms and CC/D are latex.
	- **Condom**: prevents entrance into the vaginal canal.
		- Protects against HIV/AIDS, Gonorrhea, but **NOT** genital warts, herpes, and pediculosis.
	- **Cervical Cap**/**Diaphragm**: prevents entrance into the cervical canal. These are combined with spermicide to have improved effectivity.
		- The use of a condom is contraindicated, as friction may damage both contraceptives. The woman is no longer protected from STDs.
		- After ejaculation, the cervical cap is **not to be manipulated or removed 6 to 8 hours after ejaculation**, but not to be retained for more than 24 hours. If maintained for longer, **Toxic Shock Syndrome** results, often caused by *E. coli* and *Staphylococcus aureus* resulting in **diarrhea and respiratory infection respectively**.
	- **IUD**: prevents entrance into the fallopian tubes. The most common form is the **Copper T IUD**, inserted **during menstruation** to ensure the woman is not pregnant. This IUD may stay within the uterus for 10 years.
		- The most common problem with IUDs is the displacement or expulsion of the IUD, often presenting as pain.
		- An IUD, if placed before pregnancy, may coexist with a pregnancy.
2. **Chemical**; **Spermicides**: only 80% effective; the least effective.
