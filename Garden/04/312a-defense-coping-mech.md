"**Coping**" is any effort done to reduce stress responses. It may be **constructive**; task-oriented (direct problem solving) or defense-oriented (regulate stress via defense mechanisms), or **destructive**, where the individual often avoid the problem. A coping mechanism operates on a *conscious* level of awareness.

"**Defense Mechanisms**" also known as "**ego defense mechanisms**" or "**protective defenses**" are **patterns of behavior or thought utilized to protect oneself** from threatening internal or external aspects. It allows an individual to **maintain control, safety, self-esteem, lessen discomfort, cope with stress, and decrease anxiety**. A defense mechanism operates on an *unconscious* level of awareness.

- **Anticipation**: planning ahead for realistic expectations.
- **Compensation**: making up for imagined or actual handicaps or deficiency through other means; overachieving in one area to compensate for perceived deficiencies in another. Someone lacking athletic ability might excel in academics.
- **Compromise**: give-and-take dynamics; often seen in relationships.
- **Sublimation**: channeling socially unacceptable behavior to a socially acceptable one. It is the **most constructive defense mechanism**. An individual with aggressive tendencies might become a competitive athlete to channel their aggression constructively.

# Narcissistic Defense Mechanism
The most **primitive** mechanism often utilized by children. These mechanisms eliminate the need to cope with **reality**.
- **Denial**: **refusal to acknowledge reality** or the truth to avoid facing a painful situation. For instance, a person with a drinking problem might insist they don't have an issue despite evidence to the contrary.
- **Projection**: **blaming others** for one's own undesirable feelings, thoughts, or traits to others. An individual who is competitive and sees winning as crucial may accuse others of being overly competitive.
- **Fantasy**: gratification of wishes through **imagination**.

___

# Immature Defense Mechanism
Often seen in **adolescents** and some **non-psychotic individuals**; it **lessens distress and anxiety-provoking situations**. Excessive use of these defenses are seen as **socially undesirable** (immature, difficulty, out-of-touch).
- **Conversion**: transferring **emotional conflict into physical symptoms** without medical basis. This can manifest as paralysis or other sensory deficits. For instance, intense anxiety might lead to temporary leg paralysis.
- **Malingering**: **fabrication of ailments**.
- **Fixation**: psychosocial development ceases to advance.
- **Regression**: returning to **previous developmental stages**— behaviors and patterns of earlier stages of development as a way to cope with stress. An adult under stress might start biting their nails, a habit from childhood.
- **Identification**: unconscious attempts to **change oneself as another, admired person**. Taking on characteristics of someone else to reduce anxiety by feeling secure with one's self-concept.
- **Introjection**: sub-type of identification in which **a person incorporates beliefs or values of other individuals into themselves**. Incorporating external beliefs into one's identity without critically evaluating them. Someone might internalize a parent's strong political beliefs without questioning them.
- **Intellectualization**: **excessive reasoning** to obscure feelings. Dealing with emotions by focusing excessively on facts, logic, and intellectual aspects of a situation. Faced with loss, someone might research grief instead of experiencing their emotions.
- **Suppression**: **consciously pushing distressing thoughts, emotions, or memories out of awareness**. A student might consciously suppress thoughts about an upcoming exam to avoid feeling anxious.
- **Isolation**: **blocking feelings** associated with unpleasant experiences; **may be physical or emotional**.
- **Symbolism**: conscious use of an alternate idea or object to represent another idea or object.

# Neurotic Defense Mechanisms
Often seen in **obsessive-compulsive**, **hysterical individuals** and adults under stress. These are **advantageous** in short-term coping situations, but can cause **long-term problems in relationships and life** if used as a primary coping method.
- **Displacement**: **releasing anger** in a **less threatening** way; redirecting emotions, usually anger, onto a safer target. If frustrated by a boss, someone might take out their anger on their family.
- **Dissociation**: **blocking off events** from the conscious mind (e.g., amnesia). Separating oneself from reality or a situation to avoid distressing emotions. This can result in feeling disconnected or observing experiences from a distance.
- **Substitution**: **replacing original goals** or desires with a more attainable one. Someone unable to pursue a dream career might focus on building a fulfilling personal life.
- **Rationalization**: **justification of behavior** to make them acceptable. The individual creates logical explanations or justifications for behaviors or situations to make them appear less threatening. Someone passed over for a promotion might say they didn't want it anyway.
- **Reaction Formation**: reacting in a way that is **opposite of what is felt**. Expressing the opposite of one's true feelings as a way to manage uncomfortable emotions. Someone disliking a coworker might be overly friendly.
- **Repression**: **involuntary forgetfulness** of unacceptable thoughts— pushing distressing thoughts or memories out of conscious awareness. Someone might have no memory of a car accident due to repression.
- **Undoing**: engaging in **behaviors opposite of previous unacceptable actions**. Engaging in actions to counteract a previous undesirable action. Someone berating their partner might later buy them gifts as a way of compensating.
