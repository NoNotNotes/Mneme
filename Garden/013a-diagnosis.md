Nursing diagnosis entails **problem identification**. It is a **clinical judgment about the client's responses to actual and potential health problems or life processes**. It is based on critical analysis of assessment data and identified client strengths and problems. In contemporary standards, the **[North American Nursing Diagnosis Association](https://nanda.org/)** (NANDA) for nursing diagnoses. A nursing diagnosis can focus on different types of problems:

| Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actual nursing diagnosis**   | **Problem-based**. A problem **present at the time of assessment**. Ex.: "*Altered respiratory status*", "*Impaired ability to cope*"                       |
| **Health promotion diagnosis** | Client **preparedness to improve** health condition. Ex.: "*Willingness to learn about the health maintenance*", "*Willingness to change health practices*" |
| **Risk nursing diagnosis**     | **Problem-based**, for problems **not yet present** but whose **risk factors are present**. Ex.: "*Risk for or Potential for impaired breathing patterns*"  |
| **Syndrome diagnosis**         | **Syndromes** are a set of similar nursing diagnoses that occur together, and can be resolved with similar interventions. Ex.: "*Chronic Pain Syndrome*"    |
| **Wellness diagnosis**         | A state of **health** that may be further **enhanced** by health promoting activities. Ex.: "*Readiness of enhanced spiritual wellbeing*"                   |
>[!WARNING] vs. Medical Diagnoses
>Medical diagnoses name the disease at hand, its pathology, and does not describe *human responses*. As long as the disease remains, this diagnosis does not change. In contrast, nursing diagnoses describe human responses to the disease *process* or health problem. These change throughout the disease process and can change frequently.

# Components of a Nursing Diagnosis
1. **Problem**: the **health problem**, **response**, or **status** of the patient. These are paired with **qualifiers** that add context to the problem. These are words such as "*Deteriorated*", "*Vulnerable to threat*", "*Incomplete*". These are **diagnostic labels** that direct the formation of client goals and desired outcomes.
2. **Etiology**: one or more **probably causes of the health problem**, giving direction to required nursing therapy. These specify the health problem to the individual at hand, providing client-centered care.
3. **Signs and Symptoms**: **clusters of signs and symptoms** that indicate the presence of a particular diagnostic label. These are used for actual nursing diagnoses, and are not available for risk nursing diagnoses.
___
# Diagnostic Process
1. **Analyze Data**: collect and compare significant assessment cues against standards. Cluster these cues for a tentative hypothesis, and identify gaps and inconsistencies (conflicting or erroneous data).
2. **Identify Health Problems, Risks, or Strengths**
3. **Formulate Diagnostic Statement**: using the components of the nursing diagnosis to create a one-part, two-part, or three-part diagnosis:
	- **One-part Statement**: only the problem (nursing diagnosis) is stated, with no etiology or signs/symptoms necessary. Ex.: "*Readiness for enhanced community coping*".
	- **Two-part Statement**: the problem and its etiology, often used for risk statements, as patients do not yet have signs and symptoms. Ex.: "*Non-adherence (diabetic diet) **related to** denial of having disease*", "*Anxiety **related to** threat to physiologic integrity: possible cancer diagnosis*"
	- **Three-part Statement**: a full statement of the three components of a nursing diagnosis. Ex.: "*Impaired self-esteem **related to** feelings of rejection by husband **as manifested by** hypersensitivity to criticism; states "I don't know if I can manage by myself" and rejects positive feedback*".

# Writing a Nursing Diagnosis
1. State a **problem**, not a **need**: `Alteration in fluid` rather than `Fluid replacement`.
2. Word the statement so that it is **legally advisable**; avoid "*incriminatory*" statements that predispose the nurse to complaints: `Altered skin integrity related to improper positioning` insinuates that the problem is caused by negligent care â†’ `Altered skin integrity related to immobility`
3. Use **non-judgmental statements**: `Impaired spirituality related to inability to attend church services secondary to immobility` rather than `Impaired spirituality related to strict rules necessitating church attendance`.
4. **Avoid redundancy** between the problem and etiology: `Altered skin integrity related to ulceration of sacral area` is a self-referencing diagnosis. Instead, write `Potential for altered skin integrity related to immobility`.
5. Ensure correctness of the **cause-and-effect relationship**: `Pain related to headache` is invalid as the headache does not cause pain; it is pain itself. Instead, `Pain: severe headache related to avoidance of narcotics due to fear of addiction` provides an appropriate etiological statement.
6. Word the diagnosis **specifically** and **precisely**: `Alteration in mucous membrane integrity related to noxious agent` identifies the etiology, but does not specify the type of interventions potentially required. Instead, `Alteration in mucous membrane integrity related to decreased salivation secondary to radiation of neck` can point nurses to the proper interventions to use.
7. Use **nursing terminology** rather than medical terminology to describe the client's response: `Potential for pneumonia` is medical in nature; `Potential for altered respiratory status related to accumulation of secretions in lungs` better fits a nurse's field of knowledge. Similarly, etiologies should also use nursing terminology: `...related to accumulation of secretion in lungs` rather than `...related to pneumonia`.
