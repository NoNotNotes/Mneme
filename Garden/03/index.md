**Community Health Nursing** is a nursing occupation that primarily takes place outside of the hospital setting. It's found in NP1, the very first part of the [[pnle|PNLE]]. It tackles the provision of healthcare services, preventive care, and most importantly health promotion with health education in a community-based setting. It's not exactly the dream occupation of many nurses, but its value is well-recognized and vital in promoting community-level wellness.

>[!TIP] Ratings?
>**Ratings** are based on a very limited sample size of lecturers (four!) who have rated a topic's **relevance to the board exam** from the options "*Low Priority*" (1), "*Nice to Know*" (3), and "*Must Know*" (5). I'll keep asking around for more input from reviewers!
