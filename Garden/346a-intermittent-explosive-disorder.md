**IED** is characterized by **repeated episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior, and angry verbal outbursts**, often lasting less than 30 minutes. **Physical injury to the self and others, and property destruction may occur**. Notably, **emotional outbursts and reactions are out of proportion** with the stimuli. After episodes, **remorse and embarrassment may be felt**, but this does not deter future episodes from occurring.
- **Onset, Incidence, Etiology**: IED may begin at any age, but is common during adolescence and young adulthood. **It is related to childhood exposure to trauma, neglect, or maltreatment**. Other potential causes include neurotransmitter imbalances esp. of serotonin, plasma tryptophan depletion, and frontal lobe dysfunction.
- Most people with IED have a concomitant psychiatric condition e.g. (most commonly) substance use/abuse, ADHD, ODD, conduct disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression.

# Treatment and Management
1. **Pharmacologic Treatment**:
	- **Fluoxene** (Prozac)
	- **Lithium**
	- **Anticonvulsant Mood Stabilizers** e.g. Valproic Acid (Depakote), Phenytoin (Dilantin), Topiramate (Topamax), and Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal).
	- **Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Antidepressants** (SSRIs) seem to reduce aggressive impulses and irritability in many people, but do not eliminate the outbursts.
2. Other treatments may be used such as **cognitive behavioral therapy**, **anger management strategies**, **avoidance of alcohol and other substances**, and relaxation techniques.
